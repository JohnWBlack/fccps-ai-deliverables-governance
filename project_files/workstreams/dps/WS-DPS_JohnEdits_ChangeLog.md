# WS-DPS Draft — John edits (summary)

Key edits applied to Jillian’s v0.1 draft:

- Added **Escalation Rules** (apply to all tiers): (1) identity linkage/integration (SSO/SIS/LMS), (2) consequential-use, (3) student artifacts re-identification caution.
- Refined Tier descriptions:
  - Tier 1: clarified **no student artifacts transmitted**; added **Tier 1 affirmation** and usage constraints.
  - Tier 2: reframed as **de-identified/aggregated**; added **re-identification prohibition**, **no advertising/model-training** clause expectation, and **change-notice** requirement.
  - Tier 3: expanded to include **identity-linked systems**; added **504/ADA alignment** reference; clarified “right-sized” impact/bias review; strengthened incident/terms-change language.
- Updated **Step 1 classification** table to include integration and consequential-use triggers and corrected typos.
- Updated **Step 2 “What must be true”** table:
  - Added vendor-terms requirement prohibiting advertising/model training (unless authorized).
  - Added vendor material-change/subprocessor notice requirement.
  - Restored pilot requirement to Tier 3 only.
- Rebuilt **Tradeoffs** table into 5 clean decision points (added BYO vs district-provided; minimization vs personalization).
- Cleaned minor typos/formatting and clarified co-lead discussion prompts.
