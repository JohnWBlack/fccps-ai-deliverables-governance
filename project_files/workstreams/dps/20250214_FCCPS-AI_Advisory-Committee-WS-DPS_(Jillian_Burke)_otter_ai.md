# SUMMARY

The AI Policy Development Meeting focused on creating flexible policies to address issues like trading in schools and safeguarding against lawsuits. John Black emphasized the need for mutual respect and autonomy to prevent misconduct. The discussion included the importance of aligning AI policies with existing laws like Section 504 and the ADA. They debated the balance between using student ID numbers for data privacy and the limitations of open AI. The meeting also covered the need for comprehensive staffing plans, the impact of AI on job roles, and the challenges of implementing AI policies in government systems.

## Action Items

-   [ ] @John Black - Compile a list of suggested language insertions/tweaks for the draft policy and email that list to the draft owner and committee
-   [ ] @John Black - Follow up with outstanding contributors and prod the three missing responses to the risks-and-opportunities assessment so the work streams can proceed
-   [ ] @John Black - Provide clarity/fidelity on the presentation schedule and when the data-privacy work stream lead will need to present at the next meeting
-   [ ] Send the draft data-privacy document as a Word file to the committee for feedback (convert PDF to Word and distribute)
-   [ ] Prepare additional inputs on implementation, equity, and access (review other sections and incorporate relevant content into the draft)

# OUTLINE

## AI Policy Alignment with Legal Standards

-   The AI policy must align with Section 504 and ADA requirements, ensuring consistent protection for all students, including those with disabilities.

## AI Data Privacy and Amplification Challenges

-   AI amplifies existing data privacy flaws, requiring closed systems to protect sensitive information while preserving valuable insights.

## Data Security Training and Workforce Adaptation

-   The discussion highlighted the need to integrate data security training into workforce roles, emphasizing adaptability as a key factor for future job changes.

## Role Shifts and AI Integration in Education Staffing

-   Government staffing changes create friction, limiting role adjustments.
-   AI automates tasks, requiring IT staff to rescope work and train others.

## Tools, Formats, and Student Privacy in Education

-   John Black explained markdown’s lightweight structure and its compatibility with notetaking apps like Obsidian.
-   The speakers discussed the challenges of student privacy, noting that no identifiers should be included unless explicitly approved.
-   They highlighted the tension between districtapproved tools and bringyourowndevice policies, suggesting schools may need additional grants for external tools.

## BYO Tools and Data Security Challenges

-   Schools cannot dictate which personal devices students use.
-   Strict security protocols are needed to prevent data leaks.

## Data Privacy Draft Leadership and Reference Management

-   John Black assigned the unknown speaker to lead the data privacy draft, citing their thorough background and contributions.

**Jillian Burke** 00:00

Like the trading wasn't happening in school and yet, you know? And so it's just making sure our policies, like flexible, like that. But then it's also going to be like, we need to also safeguard ourselves from, like, these lawsuits that could happen potentially,

**John Black** 00:15

because so there's protecting from the downside, but then there's also promoting the upside, right? So, so so with the Pokemon card thing, it's like that was the absence of teaching mutual respect, right, and, and, you know, autonomy and, and things like that, that if they had those concepts on them, maybe they wouldn't do that. Now, of course, when those things fail, then there has to be a backstop, right? You know, the consequences of doing the negative thing, or knowing what the line is, or you didn't tell me I couldn't do that. Well, okay? And we told you you couldn't do that, right, right?

**Jillian Burke** 00:53

And then we have to respond, the school district be responsible. So, like, that's why I kind of put, like, the special consideration with students with disabilities, like it kind of in its own tier, because because a for protection and distinguish and distinguish it, but also, should it also just be included? Because, therefore, it's being inclusive that we're doing this for all of our student body.

**John Black** 01:16

Yes, well, and there's, there is already law that you know, section 504, and the ADA, that, you know, we're on the hook to, you know, comply with that already. So our AI, you know, policy should be consistent with that, right? And so that's, it's probably good to call it out, because there's already legal, you know, structures in place, yes.

**Jillian Burke** 01:41

And it's very lengthy and very long, very lengthy, that

**John Black** 01:47

was a good call.

**John Black** 01:55

Escalators, yeah, yeah. So like my little escalator to the tier three is if tool connects to a Learning Management System or single sign on or any identity linked system, then instead of just kind of giving it, you automatically triggers a tier three review, yeah, all right, you talk about student artifacts, right? What is the difference in

**John Black** 02:46

okay? So, so one is, you know, like identifying information, right? If the student's name is in there, that's identifying that we have, like this traditional red flags of like, what is PII? I have PII training in the military, AI is unbelievable in its ability to fill in missing puzzle pieces, and so that that level of care that you have to exercise to have any protection is is higher, like just, here's a little privacy vignette. Adriana said she stepped outside the house yesterday and her Bluetooth headset connected to a conversation that she wasn't in. It may have been something on a stream. I don't know if it was actually like a phone like a phone I can't I don't think it was a phone conversation, but, you know, she, she told me some of the words, right, and and I would say less than 25 words, and I threw that into chat. TPT told me who everybody was and what they were talking about, and what the legal issues were it when they were lawyers. So it was like, Holy shit, you know? Yeah, it only so it only takes a tiny bit of leakage to expose much more than not more, not just much more than you would intend, more than you would ever think.

**Jillian Burke** 04:24

And you know, that's a big thing, you know? I mean, we may say like, oh, we'll just use student ID numbers. Okay, yes, yet that can still be linked to the individual fixing with initials. And so, how to discard information, but then also how to keep the information, because it is rich data, so we're learning, yes, valuable. And so that's where open AI has the biggest flaw of it's open. And so we need to have a closed AI. But then then the closed AI is just too is in a vacuum. So then, you know,

**John Black** 05:03

so, so a lot of like, what, what comes with AI is the exacerbation of whatever flaws we've already, we already have, or whatever strengths too, but because you can just amplify, it becomes like a prosthesis for your brain, right? But if, if you're not curious, if you're not, if you're not have some concept of privacy and safety to start with, it's going to, it's going to be a real problem, right? But if you do have a good so a lot of what we need to put in the AI policy are things like that that require people to just already be practicing good security, data hygiene. On the on positive side, they need to be curious. They need to have agency. They need to to be the drivers and not passengers in their education, or they're not going to get value out of it.

**Jillian Burke** 06:04

Yeah, and that's kind of where you know that the implementation, I know this is the data piece, but then implementation piece will be drawing from the data, our privacy of like, what does that look like for maintenance on that security breach and that security development? Because it's changing. It's going to change. And then who are the ones that need to be taught it? And then, I mean, everyone needs to be taught it, like CPR, right? But how to distinguish what is appropriate for which? I guess position. I think I also have let me see if I can find in my dissertation, I know I wrote something about it,

**Jillian Burke** 06:50

because I think I gave you the program services. Did I give you the program? I'm like scrolling. Fine. I may not

**Jillian Burke** 07:13

sorry. I'm just gonna share. I'm just, I should have had this already up. Yeah, you want to share. So, yeah, I think this is kind of it. This is just like a snippet of it. Um, of it. And so can I make this bigger, though? Okay, so I'm just gonna go through the Canva right now. It's in a different spot, but it's just the easiest. So here you know that the pros like staffing plan, right? That I think can help our policy for the district to kind of consider, would they have, like, additional slots spots open for new positions, or do we have another position that is kind of, that could be, this could be a shared additional responsibility, you know, like the how, like a program manager if we were to really have like managing, like the data security and the training, but I think here,

**John Black** 08:08

you're tapping into what is going to be one of the biggest upheavals in workforce that we're going to see is, is that everybody's job changes.

**Jillian Burke** 08:20

Yes, it needs to be adaptable.

**John Black** 08:23

And well, so does, does the job change, or does a new position get added and an other position go away? And yeah, and each one of those has its own, creates its own friction. And by the way, that's just assuming no more money, right? If there's more money, which is, add more people, right? Add more roles. But then that's not necessarily optimal either, because things are changing, and change and change is hard and and school systems are, you know, I mean, it's government, you know, it's, it doesn't operate on a profit, right? Because in a company, they'll say, oh, yeah, I'm sorry, the business has changed. You know, accountable for shareholders, your positions gone, right? And that sucks, but, but in government, they don't do that that much. Not much at all. And so it's very, it's going to be very difficult to get. And this is important, because how do you get the how do you implement this stuff if there's not people doing it?

**Jillian Burke** 09:31

And so I know, like in the Prop staffing plan that I have that's more in depth in my my dissertation, of course, is kind of like, Okay, do we use the current IT staff, you know, who are now providing those technical supports and expertise? But then do we have like, another layer of like we already know

**John Black** 09:52

clearly, clearly, it is hugely impacted, right? And so stuff that would have been manual is now automated, stuff that would have been humans, you know, making, you know, yeah, humans should be in the loop, but AI can figure it out, right and figure it out. But now what that means the IT person has to, they have to reach the rescope their work,

**Jillian Burke** 10:18

and do the rescoping their work, but also understanding of their strengths, like they may not be the best when it comes to training. And so then, like, you know, in my dissertation, I kind of talk about, like, well, those who already know how to kind of teach and train will be the social workers. Could be the school counselors, and also, of course, the teachers too, yeah, but like, in their scope, you know, so the social social worker can be talking about the

**John Black** 10:39

scope of social workers revenge, right? Because, because, you know, like a lot of a lot of process oriented, technical oriented work, it's just going to be like, you know, AI, but you empathy, empathy is not going to be something AI is going to take over anytime soon.

**Jillian Burke** 11:00

No, and it's trying to test or I think, yeah, so I guess you know, I wasn't trying to add, like, too, too much, but I also try to make sure I am capturing what we need to capture, but then not also diluting the process.

**John Black** 11:20

Well, it's all going to converge on on the fourth of March, the work streams, right? And that the work streams, which are all specific areas, are going to come in, and we're going to, you know, rack and stack principles based on what the work streams input, and then, and then start drafting policy. So there's a lot. So having too much is, is really not a problem, right? It's gonna, it's gonna converge, right? Promise. So I think it's helpful, yeah, honestly, because, because the more you put, the greater the context is, especially if we're using AI to help us get to the convergence, it is really helpful for us to envision how implementation works and how staffing supports implementation. It definitely considering that will, even if those recommendations end up being outside the scope of our of our policy recommendations, the fact that we're considering and envisioning what they are is going to make our policy recommendations stronger and more likely to, you know, to survive, to be approved and then, and then, ultimately, to be implemented. I support it.

**Jillian Burke** 12:34

What recommendation do you have or feedback that I could, you know, brush upon in the draft that we have, that I have that should be added or and I can also make sure I send this in a word. I think I just since in the PDF list, you can convert it into a word,

**John Black** 12:54

okay, yeah, I converted it to to mark down from my AI friends like it because it's well, so mark down is text. It's it's purely text. So like, like HTML. HTML is, mark up, mark down is. It's similar in that, at the end of the day, it's not a binary file, it's a text file, which means it's so much more lightweight. You know, this kind of looks goofy to you now, right? Because you're like, you're not used to seeing these hash marks. So applications like obsidian, which has become really popular for note taking, use this. And when you, when you either click on something, make something heading one, it applies these, these little hash marks. But then you know, if you have a markdown friendly app, then it, it can convert it automatically to a prettier, you know, format for you, but, but the computer doesn't need pretty. The computer needs structure, right? And, and that's and then, because there's this idea of the token, you know, when the context window and the token quotas, getting that to be as lightweight as possible is, is really helpful. So anyway, this was marked down until I pasted it into a document item in Miro.

**Jillian Burke** 14:33

Or does it, what is it free there?

**John Black** 14:36

There is there are free accounts? Yes. Now what you can do in terms of creating and inviting is limited, but you can, you know, I definitely encourage you to get a free account and you can, then you can use the apps as well. They have a desktop app, and and Android. I imagine they have iOS too. I didn't share, yeah,

**Jillian Burke** 15:07

Apple, unfortunately. But then I use Microsoft.

**John Black** 15:10

They have to. They have to. I mean, it's so this is so favored by creative types. And creative types love iOS. So, I mean, consider myself a creative type, but for whatever reason, I'm in the I'm firmly in the Microsoft ecosystem.

**Jillian Burke** 15:26

Stuff is like, Canva, where you saw my Yeah, Canva

**John Black** 15:29

is really cool. My kids love it, yeah?

**Jillian Burke** 15:32

I mean, I only probably got it because as a student, it was free for me to my doctor. I was like, oh, let's use this. You know, great.

**John Black** 15:43

Okay, let me see if there's anything else I wanted to pick out of here. And I still

**Jillian Burke** 15:48

have time, but I do want to respect your time, like I don't have another thing until 12. Okay, yeah,

**John Black** 15:52

I'm good as well. I'm good as well. Probably is hunger that was is going to probably get me off this call. My wife will tell me when it's time to go. Where was that thing? Place was grading? Yeah, so we already covered that, right? So maybe this language no student identifiers and no student generated artifacts that could reasonably re identify a student unless explicitly approved. Now, that'll be a very tough line to call, but that's just what it is, right? That it is tough. It's, but it's saying that it's, it's, the bar is higher than just your name, social security number.

**Jillian Burke** 16:37

We want to be saying stuff like that. Like that is okay language. I think,

**John Black** 16:41

I think so. I think so it, I think it'll trigger some discussion in our community, for sure, which is

**Jillian Burke** 16:49

fine, right? Yeah, absolutely everyone to have collaboration and contribution to it. But we're also like, we're trying to see it from all angles,

**John Black** 16:58

district approved, versus bring your own tools.

**Jillian Burke** 17:03

And that one is tricky, because, like those you know, like school to Bell law, belt, wait not school to Bell. Bell to bell law, where you can't have your own personal device, a smart device, you know, those are that's spreading nationwide to different schools. Yeah, it's just catching up to, like, the what ifs, you know, and then providing it. That does mean the school has to probably access more grants to accommodate those tools outside of someone's medical needs.

**John Black** 17:35

So what's going to be interesting here is, we don't we're not making any recommendations that are procurement. We're not, we're not well, we're not blessing any So, like everybody should use Gemini, or everybody should use, you know, any, whatever the vendor is, right? So that's not our skill, but, but this, you know, byo tools is an issue, right? That is not, not specifically about pure procurement. We're not talking about what the school district is procuring, what we're talking about other people, what the students and parents and and staff may already have, right?

**Jillian Burke** 18:14

I mean, like we were talking about, like, the pens that people could have and record a whole conversation. We're talking about smart glasses that could, you know, create issues even that. So, like, there's so much continue to happening, like, what to protect our students, right, and also to protect our staff and the integrity, and again, it may be just more like we have more expectations and Student Handbook policies around safe technology, use of your own items, and what that looks like being a safe, I don't know, computer citizen, device AI citizen, yeah,

**John Black** 18:57

but that's once again, it's going to Go back to the fact that you're just not going to be able to practically as a practical matter. You're not going to be able to control that. People are going to use their own tools. You know, we're in the military where I work, there are some very hard lines right where we're talking when they and they have a very robust way of labeling and classifying, have security classifications and they're just, are these are just hard lines, right? It doesn't even touch another system or network if it's at a higher level of classification, yeah, and so that makes it, I mean, I'm not saying it's not hard. It is very hard, especially when you know, you start talking to AI about things that you reasonably you know that are unclassified, and then it starts making stuff that you say, okay, that yes, something I have seen on a classified system, and then you just kind of quietly close the window, because yeah,

**Jillian Burke** 20:08

and stop talking and moving on, right? But there's a reason why there's classified areas that people can only discuss certain things in a certain like, literally, room with none of their personal devices and are checked in, right? Well, I mean, we don't need to make our schools military already, kind of military like in a sense, yeah.

**Jillian Burke** 20:32

So, okay, so, because I know it's just you and I in this one, this data privacy one, yeah, unless anyone else, well,

**John Black** 20:41

so honestly, all the work streams are for everyone, right? And so we can have as many contributors as as we want or as we're willing to participate, right? That's, you know, there's but, but you're, you know, I asked you to lead it, because you definitely show that your background and your and your contributions show that that you have affinity for it. So that's why I could see in the quality of your document that it's already very thorough. And when things that I could come up with the help of my a friends are just, are just tweaks, but then again, a couple years of working on it, right, right, right? No, this is your area, right? But watch, right? We'll bring it, we'll bring it to the committee, and then we'll have some very different, you know, divergent opinions. And that's okay, that's, that's good, right? I think, I mean, I'm just here to be a bit of a sanity test. And I do think a lot about, you know, attacks and then, because of my cyber security background, but, and so these things that you know that I've got here, just tweaks right there, there, it's on target, it's it's, you're not, you're there's definitely a discussion about scope that we're going to have to have, but nothing here is off base. So, but if you want to pull in other folks before the meeting, just have to do it. One to One, having these one, yeah, that's the only. That's the only, you know. And if you want to pull in up people from outside the committee, but you already, I mean, like, you've already done all this research. This is not it is

**Jillian Burke** 22:35

I'm going back and forth. Like, do I need to send people like, my, pretty much, my, gosh, my major gain. Words, my crown, my brain is completely fried, references, my reference pages of everything. But I also was going back and forth. I'm like,

**John Black** 22:50

I love your I love that you have references. Because I I get when I write something for company or even for the military, and then I use APA format and references. They're like, Why do you have all this shit? Like, because I'd like to know where the breadcrumbs are that got us to this right, and then somebody's going to come after me, right? And then maybe something I wrote would be useful to them, but it's more useful when it have provenance, right? And it's very hard to get that idea across to a lot of folks I don't know. Like, look, I already know

**Jillian Burke** 23:22

how to write MLA, and that was like, how we first started. I didn't tell you where to start.

**John Black** 23:27

Well, now it's like, Oh, it doesn't matter. MLA, APA, I triple E, you know, AI is your friend? Like, reformat, these references a different format. Like, okay, cool. So then there's no earthly reason not to have them absolutely.

**Jillian Burke** 23:43

And I'm constantly like, these fake videos of they're becoming so authentic. I was like, Wait, did this event really happen? And I'm like, going through, like, Google, Gemini. Ai like, No, Joe, this was fake.

**John Black** 23:54

Um, have you used illicit? Illicit? Check it out. You're gonna love it. So this elicit. It does academic citations. It does that, yeah, it essentially will create your annotated bibliography for you.

**Jillian Burke** 24:12

That would've been helpful. Good stuff. Yeah, I actually got in trouble for oversighting. I was like, well, that's a good thing, right? Professor, no,

**John Black** 24:20

but it illicit has, specifically, has in its train database all the academic sources which might not be publicly available. True, yeah, so, so when it gives you the sites, a lot of times, it'll give you a link to this, you know, to the full text, but sometimes that that's not available, and yet you still have the site,

**Jillian Burke** 24:41

yeah, but just so when you sort but you know site for it, and then you get permission, which I have actually numerous times, from authors, and usually they can hand it over,

**John Black** 24:52

yeah, yeah, absolutely, when they see that, you know your intentions are, you know, to build on their work, yeah, yeah.

**Jillian Burke** 25:00

So for a meeting on next Friday, yeah, what a group is presenting Is that how it's gonna be framed?

**John Black** 25:07

Yeah, it's Yeah. So it's gonna, I'm trying to keep this format of, like, Okay, we did some work in the last meeting, in the in the focus session. Then they have some stuff that they were asked to, inputs they are providing. In the interim, what I want to do is get the work stream lead that the last focus session pertained to, kind of do a brief out right? It's kind of like in the what is it Robert's rules as the old business? And then we do a focus session that kind of builds on the inputs from the interim. So it'll be, I'm hoping to have somebody leading the discussion at each meeting, or might have to do some, you know, multiple people as well, if, as we get towards the next meeting after this. So, but, yeah, but this one coming up is, is going to be risks and opportunities and closing out the discussion from from here, from the share baseline, right?

**Jillian Burke** 26:17

Yes, that's what it was. So then I guess the risks and assessments coming in, like how you kind of posted the draft here of the data and the privacy, you will see that in advance to then,

**John Black** 26:32

yeah, and Right, right. You'll have a head you'll have a heads up. I'd like to give people as much heads up as possible. So I've still, I've still missing three responses to the to the risks and opportunities assessment and and if I can't get them today, I've just got to go, go ahead and push ahead, because I'm going to ask somebody in my and possibly you right to chime in on these things, right? But you're already, I mean, you're, I don't, I don't ever want to put people on the spot, like, really horribly, but

**Jillian Burke** 27:05

you that's a learning curve of opportunity, of like, you know, that's how we remember things. Okay, yeah, yeah. I know. I see your emails. I was like, not really. Sometimes, like, send emails, and then I, like, circle around, like, I'm gonna send it, like, schedule emails, and I got the work done, but, like, but hit Send someone's gonna, know, like, two o'clock morning.

**John Black** 27:30

I have that in my business account, right? So if you want to send this during normal business hours, so you don't look like a complete tool, like, Yeah, but public.com doesn't have that feature.

**Jillian Burke** 27:43

So, okay, Claudio, the implement, take my other piece, but again, I'm gonna look at the other like equity and access. Yeah.

**John Black** 27:52

So Tom and Elizabeth are gonna synthesize this. But they can, I mean, they could already do that from here, it's, it's already kind of, you know, like, so we have, we kind of halfway did it in the last session, right? But they, but I'm up, I'm gonna, you know, I want to let them fill in the blanks here. There's already, you know, been a vote, so to speak, as to, how should we look at this, right? What should be our grade bands, Yes, yep, but I'm not doing it for them, right? They're gonna, they're gonna have to do it and present it.

**Jillian Burke** 28:37

Well, good luck with getting those extra free

**John Black** 28:42

inputs, yeah, I'm about to prod them. See, Adriana would be much better at this than I would be.

**Jillian Burke** 28:51

And we're in crunch time. I mean, it started with crunch time because it's really compact,

**John Black** 28:57

yeah, oh, it's, it's a heck, really is a heck of an assignment, don't you

**Jillian Burke** 29:02

think dad, but it's okay. It's okay. Yeah, all right. Well, yeah, no, always like, reach out. I'll reach out to and, yeah, I guess now I'll kind of like, poke around on other things too, that I've done this part.

**John Black** 29:18

I will try to get you fidelity on, on, on, when you're gonna have to present something,

**Jillian Burke** 29:23

yeah, I appreciate that. And then I'm gonna look up some publishing things just to safeguard my dissertation, like product, yeah, when I'm straight,

**John Black** 29:31

well, I mean, you can throw, you know, yourself, you can, you can declare copyright, yeah, you don't need to register that. You just have to say, yeah,

**Jillian Burke** 29:42

it's expensive. And, I mean, I know a lot of people in my program did do it, and I I don't know, I just once I got the degree, I took, like, a I just hibernated. I was like, that was a lot.

**John Black** 29:56

I finished my MBA, and you ready for your PhD? I'm like, Yeah, give me a minute,

**Jillian Burke** 30:03

hours connected

**John Black** 30:04

to it. I guess it's been nearly 10 years, so it's never too late. No, it isn't. I love schools. I love school better than anything.

**Jillian Burke** 30:13
