# Prompts and teacher scripts (select examples)

-   **Launch prompt (teacher):** “Choose an ecosystem near our school and one human activity that affects it. Be ready to explain why it matters.”
-   **AIassisted research prompt (student):** “Find two credible local examples of this impact and one mitigation used elsewhere.”
-   **Reflection prompt (student):** “What assumption did you make that changed after research? How will that change your next step?”

# Materials, tech, and timeline (high level)

-   **Materials:** Field observation checklist, poster supplies, rubric handouts, reflection journals.
