Approach to Policy Development

**Short answer:** Start with a shared, practical baseline (what AI *is* and *isn’t*), surface diverse values through structured activities, and use small, lowrisk pilots and clear safeguards so committee members can see benefits and limits in context. **Do this before drafting policy.**

# Key considerations and decision points

-   **Clarify scope:** Are we regulating tools, classroom practices, or procurement?
-   **Set success criteria:** What outcomes (equity, learning gains, teacher workload reduction, integrity) matter most?
-   **Decide pilots:** Which grades, subjects, or tasks will trial human–AI teaming first?

# Short workshop plan to level set (3 sessions)

1.  **Session 1 — Shared baseline (60 min):** Quick primer on AI capabilities/limits, examples in classrooms, and common misconceptions; Q&A. **Goal:** common language and dispel “glorified search” myths. 12
2.  **Session 2 — Values mapping (90 min):** Small groups map priorities to the cognitive pipeline (Create, Compete, Control, Collaborate). Each group lists benefits, harms, and tradeoffs. **Goal:** surface diverse perspectives and tensions. 3
3.  **Session 3 — Rapid pilots & governance (90 min):** Review 2–3 lowrisk pilot proposals, define humanintheloop checkpoints, data/privacy rules, and evaluation metrics. **Goal:** concrete next steps.

# Stakeholder engagement tactics

-   **Invite diverse voices:** teachers (varied subjects), students, parents, tech staff, curriculum leads, equity officers, and legal/privacy counsel. **Include at least one skeptical teacher** to surface real concerns. 1
-   **Use artifacts, not abstractions:** show short demo workflows (teachermediated AI feedback on drafts) rather than abstract claims. 2
-   **Run roleplay scenarios:** “AI suggests a student essay rewrite” — have groups decide actions and document rationale.

|---------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Demos + pilots            | Concrete evidence of value  | Overgeneralization from one pilot | Multiple pilots across subjects; clear metrics         |
| Values mapping workshops  | Surface tradeoffs and buyin | Timeintensive                     | Short, focused sessions with prework                   |
| Student panels            | Center learner voice        | May be dismissed                  | Summarize and present student recommendations to board |
| Data & evidence briefings | Credibility for skeptics    | Technical overload                | Onepage briefs + visual summaries                      |

# Metrics, safeguards, and governance

-   **Stagespecific KPIs:** engagement for *Create*, calibration/error rates for *Metacognition*, academic integrity incidents for *Compete*, and collaboration quality for *Collaborate*.
-   **Safeguards:** teacher final approval, disclosure of AI use, parental consent for data, anonymization for model training, and routine bias audits. 12

# Quick sample charter language (one line)

*“The committee will prioritize equitable learning outcomes, teacher agency, student privacy, and transparent humanintheloop controls; pilots must include measurable learning and equity metrics before scale.”*

# Final recommendation

Start with **one short pilot** (e.g., AIassisted formative feedback in one grade), run it for a semester with teacher oversight, collect evidence, and use that evidence plus structured values workshops to draft policy. This turns abstract fears into concrete tradeoffs and shared decisions.
