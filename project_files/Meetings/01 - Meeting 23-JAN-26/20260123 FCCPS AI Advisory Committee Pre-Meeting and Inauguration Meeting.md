# TRANSCRIPT

**Bethany Henderson** 00:00

I read that that also applies to email, Google Docs, text messages, any way that we actually functionally operate in today's world. Okay.

**John Black** 00:09

Okay, so no side meetings, no secret cliques incommittees.

**Bethany Henderson** 00:15

Yeah. But you can't do 234, you can do three, four, especially like text and stuff, because everything that is committee business could be foilable.

**John Black** 00:27

Okay, that was one of our questions we had for you. Said, what is our record, records retention, you know, burden we also need, and

**Bethany Henderson** 00:35

actually have staff to do this. And I don't know whether this is fair to ask you to go, have you introduce yourself.

**Bethany Henderson** 00:43

Do we have everyone here the chair and vice chair, so we're getting them set.

**William Bates** 00:48

Oh, okay. Is it 8am or 830 while you're here?

**William Bates** 01:00

Nice to meet you. Y'all look familiar. We

**Speaker 1** 01:05

live here, so we are out and about.

**William Bates** 01:11

Definitely look like familiar faces. Welcome and thanks for being here and helping this work.

**Bethany Henderson** 01:19

This is maybe a question for Trish, but I'm gonna ask you, because you're standing here, okay, in terms of note taking, because we don't have any sort of traditional staff, how should we handle that? We have them charged with keeping records. Or is that something that you need to handle? Or

**Speaker 2** 01:38

that's a good question. I can offer something we in our practice, use otter AI, which is a AI transcription service. What we can do is automatically, you know, transcribe the the meeting, and then output it as draft minutes to wherever official channel it needs to go to.

**William Bates** 02:03

Are you comfortable with that? Yeah, I'm fine with that. Okay, we I'm trying to think so. Years ago we had a calendar committee. It was an ad hoc Calendar Committee. There wasn't, we didn't have a whole lot of note taking, but I don't remember there being receiving any guidance around whether,

**Bethany Henderson** 02:22

Steve, we actually started 830 so you're not

**William Bates** 02:27

good, whether or not we had to publish or make public any notes. I don't remember, but actually, let me double check, because I There might have been with that particular committee, which was school board driven. We may have had to collect

**Bethany Henderson** 02:44

multiple board committees. We have to publish notes, so I just and

**William Bates** 02:48

collect any personal notes. Or I was just at her office. She's not, not here yet, but so, so there is her to

**Bethany Henderson** 03:00

confirm if we can use

**Speaker 2** 03:02

that the transcription service. So there is some requirement for publication. And then there's Working Papers, which may not, you know, there may be FOIA double, but not necessarily published, okay, but

**Bethany Henderson** 03:17

there is, if you go on the school boards committee page, you can actually click through and look at the notes of past committee meetings. So we do need to make sure notes are kept in some form or fashion. This committee is actually your committee. We are the liaison. So we are not members of the committee, voting members. That was another question. We are the go between.

**Speaker 2** 03:37

I imagine that you serve some function in terms of governance, or, you know, question escalation to the board, yes,

**Bethany Henderson** 03:44

absolutely, and one or both of us will be at every committee meeting. Probably phrase it differently. Jared will be at every and I will be at most, in person, some remotely, and I might have to miss one or two because of some

**Speaker 2** 03:58

personal and Okay, so we allowed to have it remotely? Are we allowed to have no some members attending remotely?

**Bethany Henderson** 04:05

Hybrid style can attend remotely because we are not members.

**Speaker 1** 04:08

All right, okay, but voting members cannot. Voting members

**Bethany Henderson** 04:12

can, but only in a very limited circumstance, with some it's a big pain in the black, basically. So there's,

**Adriana Palacios Bonarrigo** 04:19

I'm assuming the majority would have to be

**Speaker 2** 04:22

you should hear what they had to do to continue meetings during covid because of their bylaws. You have to change your bylaws. But then Adriana would go into the station and be the person that is on site and present and then conduct it virtually with the others. It was crazy. But anyway, we we can do whatever gymnastics are required.

**Bethany Henderson** 04:43

Things that we did was confirm that everybody would be was able to be here pretty consistently. I remember, like three times I probably got those messages. Obviously, life happens. And so certainly there are opportunities for folks, you know, on an exception old basis, to join in. And like I said, I have some really old things going on, some other stuff. And other stuff. And so I'm going to actually need to be remote a couple of times so the capability exists. These are also open meetings, so anybody from the public can come sit here and watch, anticipate the odds of happening. But just so y'all are

**Speaker 2** 05:16

aware, totally okay. Although in terms of group dynamics, probably about at max, at what we can get, you know, really high engagement for for a team, right? If, if it got to be like 15 or 20, then, then we're probably breaking up into subgroups, which then creates problems for the, you know, for the policy. So, agree,

**Bethany Henderson** 05:39

missing anything, there's a whole school work orientation that we're not taking you through. That's another hour, and it feels overkill for this.

**John Black** 05:47

Is there somewhere online where we can review that we

**Bethany Henderson** 05:50

I can, we can get you the manual, yeah, okay, anything else, significant items?

**Bethany Henderson** 06:01

The other thing is, because there's two of us, y'all can communicate. So like two of you can communicate with two of us. Does that make sense? So, like the four of us can communicate on email. You can't add another committee member or another school board,

**Speaker 2** 06:14

because that would be a third Yeah, we get that all right. So this is, this is just open notes, right? This is what we prepared today.

**Adriana Palacios Bonarrigo** 06:24

Are we running the meeting today, or is it you going to be setting up the rules and we're going to start with the setup and then turn it over?

**Speaker 2** 06:34

Okay? So what we thought was feasible for getting done is your introduction, your charge, right? Me and and I haven't asked it point blank yet, but I need to know, what is our scope? What, what are we supposed to produce? Right? You've already kind of covered what we own versus what you do, meeting constraints. We talked about the in person requirements. And you know where there, where there are three, there may not be four, there must be all and then, and then, what we propose for kickoff is to start with team formation activities, how we work, kind of thing and and what is our objective, whatever, what is our purpose. And then in the next in person meeting, we'll go into, you know, a where's that session shared baseline, and you know, like, take it from the top. What is AI? Session two mapping values. So a lot of our practice is built on Jeff to graph the competing values framework, right? You know, compete, create control. And, yeah, here's, this is last book and, and the idea is that, you know, there are different there are different values that are have friction with with one another, that when deliberately, when we do when we deliberately create constructive conflict, which produce a better product than if we just say, you know, go all the way on the control side or all the way on the Create side, you know, we want to, we want to make it a boundless product. So, so we introduce the idea of the competing values framework. Then they map values to the charge to what we're supposed to produce, and then get into into what we would call pilots or experiments that then eventually get to the work product. And then ultimately, you know, have some idea of how this is implemented in schools, and not just a document that sits on the shelf somewhere, right?

**John Black** 08:41

So there's a couple other things. This is great. There's a couple other things. One is staff will be in here. So William is the staff liaison. Another staff member, Steve, thank you. We'll be in and out as well. I think he's going to come this morning, their job is to observe and listen, and so they can stay in the loop or not to drive, but you can also there. If you have questions, it's going to be as questions about what's actually happening, practicalities or whatever, to the staff, working group has reached a series of conclusions and observations, which they share with us this week. William is going to share that with you all this morning. I want to make sure there's conclusions and observation about AI, okay, very good. So there's parallel tracks, right? There's this, there's a staff working group, there's a student group. We're going to do as part of this group will hold to or the board will hold to town halls that we'd like members of this group to participate in as listeners, right? So there's multiple moving tracks, and then all of the standing committees have been asked to weigh in. So this is all very good, yeah. But this morning, William will share with you all an overview of where the staff has come out, the staff working group, if, if they did not have that prepared then.

**John Black** 10:02

Part of our process would be to seek it out. So our four steps in our cycle are set a high quality target, enlist deep and diverse domain expertise, take multiple shots on goal to accelerate failure and learn from experience and experiment. So it's this iterative process in which we would not assume that we have all the answers here in this room. There's just no way.

**Bethany Henderson** 10:27

So the scope of this committee is best practices surrounding districts knowledge and general public input. So bringing those things

**John Black** 10:39

The Arlington Public Schools information that you sent out was very information, very helpful, as well as the the Brookings Report and and the did, they did a they did a live session, which was very rich with discussion topics.

**Bethany Henderson** 10:55

So between now and April, we're looking for this committee to really synthesize all of that. Okay? The other standing committees, their job is to look at it from the lens of their issue area. So we've got the Special Ed Committee, the academic advance committee, we've got business and education on other behalf, dozens of other standing committees. They're gonna they have PTAs, like all of those groups have been asked to weigh in through the lens of the subset of the population that they support. So y'all, I wouldn't say you don't need to worry about that. I don't mean that. But like, okay, you don't need to worry about getting input from those subsets of the community.

**Speaker 2** 11:27

So they will take that's going to come our work product. So it's our work product to that goes out to them. How does that work them?

**Bethany Henderson** 11:34

So at the April board meeting, yes, yes. At the April board meeting, that's going to be all about. AI, this committee is going to come present your work product. Okay, every other group that wants to weigh in, the students, the staff, the standing committees, whatever, any member of the public that wants to weigh in will also come present. Will also come present their request recommendations, etc. At that point, the four of us will then synthesize all of that into a draft policy, right? So that's kind of like an iteration stage. So this committee should come with like, here's what we think.

**Speaker 2** 12:15

Okay, so our and our work product for April, for the April school board meeting in April, meeting is a set of recommendations, and then the school board meeting, and it's, you know, proceedings then become the springboard for our further policy drafting. So we're not, we're not going to have policy by April, what we're going to have is recommendations.

**Bethany Henderson** 12:43

Have recommendations, and I think it would be very helpful to have a line of sight onto what a policy should look like, because otherwise it will be an incredibly painful two weeks.

**Jerrod Anderson** 12:52

And if there's you know one thing that at some point during the tasking of the committee is that, you know, at least a subgroup of the committee actually goes out and looks at what other policies actually look like. And if there, if there's policy language in those, pick and choose among those and say, Hey, here's where we think can kind of fit in with, with, with our schools, that way, like, I think envisioning like. So the the output of the committee should probably have some, it shouldn't be like a complete policy, but it should have, like a couple of doses of policy language in there. Understand.

**Bethany Henderson** 13:31

Let me make sure I have both of your email addresses correct here. John dot black, outlook.com, and a philosophy is a dot philosophy as well. On f gmail.com I'm gonna send you all some of this stuff in writing something, yeah, okay.

**Adriana Palacios Bonarrigo** 13:45

About the use of technology here. Can we use whatever program we work with?

**Bethany Henderson** 13:51

Or, Yes, you just can't. Like, I love Miro committee members cannot independently be adding things to the same Miro board. Can they look at it? They can look at it. You can be view only,

**Speaker 1** 14:04

so they cannot use it for asynchronous collaboration,

**Bethany Henderson** 14:08

correct, which is a pain in the ass.

**Speaker 1** 14:11

Okay, but they can send. Can they send emails? Can they reply to our emails,

**Bethany Henderson** 14:14

or reply directly to you, but only one of you, because both of you, makes it a three person meeting. What if they reply to all? Can they do that that is considered a meeting? Oh, wow. When I told you, like we can't actually functionally operate, like, this is a state of Virginia issue.

**John Black** 14:30

Interesting.

**Bethany Henderson** 14:31

Nice to meet you. Knowledgeable. This is Patricia Minson, our school board attorney, okay, okay, so we're going through some of the like, here's how.

**John Black** 14:46

Well, we're going to keep you close.

**Susan Nelson** 14:49

This is all that the Council of School attorneys and attorneys who do this work have been talking about recently. So I will share with you what I know, and as it changes, I'll update you all, I understand. The question is, can we use an AI note taker to take notes of the meeting minutes? That's the first question.

**Patricia Minson** 15:11

I thought there was one question

**Speaker 1** 15:14

we came up with couple more, since you were gone. The short

**Patricia Minson** 15:17

answer is yes, but we have to be really thoughtful. I'm more confident and more comfortable with that happening in a meeting of a school board committee, whether that's an ad hoc or a regular meeting, because the minutes are always approved at the next meeting. So if I'm in a meeting and taking notes and I miss something, I can turn to a colleague and say, Oh, what did I miss? Or I'm stepping up for a phone call and come back and fill the blanks I might miss a word, the word not that could be operative and change the whole meaning. So because the committee is going back to those notes and saying, Yes, this is an accurate reflection of what happened, if something is missed by the AI note taking tool, then the committee has eyes on and can check on that. One of the things that's all over the list serves is a lot of the AI note taking tools can add information or add details that in the context of the schools, could be a problem. If it says something happened that wasn't quite accurate, or if it mistakes the notes, and then we have reflected in documents that the school is committing to doing something or the committee is recommending something that it's not actually not actually recommending. So, so what if we

**John Black** 16:25

considered it personal work product, and then, then the human actually publishes. These are, these are the notes from the meeting.

**Patricia Minson** 16:35

Well, the committee actually approves it. But work product, when you say that term, what do you mean if

**Speaker 2** 16:40

I write, if I should write some notes into my paper notebook, are those now subject to FOIA?

**Patricia Minson** 16:46

Yes, okay, if you are meeting as a committee for the purpose of doing public work. So the whole idea behind FOIA is it's a Sunshine Law. We want the public to know what's going on. So all the meeting committee are going to be open so anyone can hear what happened, so anyone can come and take their own personal notes, or could use their own note taker, or could record the meeting. This means a one party recording state. So as long as one person knows that they're recording a meeting, no one else even has to be aware that it's being recorded. It's our strong preference that when we learn that someone's recording, we also record so that we have a record. So if one gets destroyed or seems to allege, we can go back and say, This is what was said. That's why I favor. Well, that's recording more than AI note taker or person taking notes. But when you when you said, work product, the reason I asked is there are exemptions under FOIA. One of those is attorney work product. But it can't just be the work product of any attorney. Has been the attorney advising in the client relationship, my notes or my recommendation, but not we have a lot of board who are attorneys.

**Speaker 2** 17:49

So the system we're using simultaneously records audio and which is very helpful, because if there's ever any doubt, you back and hear it yourself, but none to guess. We're all humans and are fallible, even our ears are fallible. So the point that you made, it's better to get like two eyes, two sets of eyes on, two sets of ears on, to say, is that what I thought I heard? Or is that, or did you have a different read on that?

**Patricia Minson** 18:15

And just like, any technology is a great tool that can help us, one of the downsides that I see that will be a question for the board in the future, is if we are allowing AI note taking, we are creating more records that are then subject to production under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act, or if we're talking about students or student data, or something that's part of the student record, it's subject to production under FERPA. So right now, if I got a FOIA request, I would need to go out to everyone who's a employee, who might have documents and have them pull those for me and go through emails and go through notes, if we have aI note takers at every meeting, and have hundreds and 1000s more pages of notes and audio recording, pulling those and redacting those. Right now, I'm the full time attorney and the full time FOIA officer, Prince William just hired. I think they have five individuals who serve as information officers, who help gather things. So if we're creating many more records that we need, then we're going to need more staff and more tools to be able to do that. Okay, not a reason not to do it, but it's something, something be mindful of, and again, in the context of a committee that's then reviewing the minutes and approving them, that's that check, whereas, if it's just a meeting of staff for the fifth grade team who's trying to gather information, unless they're going to go back and everybody's going to read the notes and say, yep, this is an accurate reflection of what happened, or, Oh, it got this wrong. Or we want to take this piece out. It's it. It will save time and be a great tool, but it could create more work down the line. So trying to balance that is something that I look forward to the advice of this committee, because it's, it's really important work. The other thing I was thinking in the context of an AI note taker for the meeting. Minutes for this meeting, the notes need to reflect the date, time and location of the meeting the members who are present, a summary of the discussion of matters proposed, deliberated or decided, and a record of any votes taken. So I could see an AI note taker spitting out 40 pages from a meeting where the actual meeting minutes probably just need to be half page. So being cognizant that we're creating more records that then would be subject to production, but it might be really helpful to have those to make sure you're doing your right work. So look to you all to figure out what that

**Speaker 1** 20:20

strike that balance? That sounds like we could spend our time, our whole time, doing that task.

**Bethany Henderson** 20:24

So that was just the first question.

**Adriana Palacios Bonarrigo** 20:29

I have a question about sharing. So can we, can we send emails to the committee as meeting agenda for the next meeting? Or is that considered part of that?

**Patricia Minson** 20:40

That's a great question. Absolutely. Can that would be subject to FOIA as well. Anytime two or more members of a committee meet or send correspondence that counts as a meeting, we discourage doing that via email, because then, if Miss Henderson asks a question, and Dr Anderson responds, and then a committee member responds, and it happens in real time. That's a meeting that no one from the public's invited to. They don't know that it's happening. So we try to have all subsequent matters happen in public, where there notice meetings. Anyone can come and listen and observe. But as far as setting out, here's the agenda for the meeting, please don't reply all that gives me information without creating a meeting, because there's

**Adriana Palacios Bonarrigo** 21:23

not right, it was going to say we're going to meet this day at this time. These are the meeting agendas. We'll discuss whatever you have. We'll discuss it at the meeting. And that's you can broadcast. Yeah, yeah.

**Bethany Henderson** 21:33

We're doing some logistics show you can broadcast out you can't then

**Adriana Palacios Bonarrigo** 21:39

have a reply all or anybody communicating with us.

**Bethany Henderson** 21:43

And one of the ways that you want to get input on the agenda is just say, please reach out to the just the chair or just the board member with anything else you'd like to add, they can gather it and then disseminate it without it being a reply all, where everyone's responding their time.

**Tom Sabo** 21:57

Yeah, when you mentioned, like, 40 page, like, note taking, like, wow, if you just did a summarization, like, straight on that right afterwards. So, you know, you almost, like, use the AI to compress it to the level that would have to be maintained. And then it's a matter of, do we have space for it? Where are we storing all this? Do we need to pay for more storage?

**Bethany Henderson** 22:28

All right, I know there's lots more questions.

**Bethany Henderson** 22:30

Why don't we take that

**Adriana Palacios Bonarrigo** 22:31

offline

**Adriana Palacios Bonarrigo** 22:31

with Trish?

**Bethany Henderson** 22:32

One of the other things on the school board is I serve on the policy subcommittee, so there's two of us that work with Jeff and all the school policies. So I love it. So we can certainly continue this, because we have a lot of the committee members are showing up. I know if you were not here and John, one of the things I noticed is there's not introductions. Good to see you all. Thank you for your work.

**John Black** 23:00

Yes, so that's part of the team formation. Is all of us getting to know each other, but, but please, you start with your introduction. Well, we don't have everybody here yet. Oh, is it possible to project on the screen?

**Bethany Henderson** 23:13

Steve?

**Steve Knight** 23:14

thpossible, yes, you need a school computer.

**Steve Knight** 23:16

Can't do it from a personal computer. Okay, so what do you need to display? Chris, a broad projector. But what do you need to display? Is it something you want to share with someone who has a school computer?

**Speaker 2** 23:37

No, is something? Well, it's, it's, they would have to log into something, and so maybe we should have a meeting offline to talk about tech. I didn't know I was going to be in this role until a couple days ago. Semper Gumby, we could do this. We could go analog.

**Bethany Henderson** 24:06

Okay, 123456789, so we're only listening if I can count.

**Bethany Henderson** 24:13

All right, let's go ahead and get started. I'm Bethany Henderson, I am one of your school board members, Jared Anderson, the other thank you all for agreeing to serve on this committee. I know I've spoken to about half of you. Jared spoke about half of you for agreeing to serve on this committee, for being part of this activity and such a compressed time frame, right? We all know this is a super important, fast moving topic, and ultimately, the committee's work will not be the end, but the beginning of how the district really integrates. A couple of just sort of baseline introductions. We have two members of staff with us here. Their job when they attend meetings is going to be to listen and observe to make sure that staff are in sync and kept up with what's going on. They are also here, in case you as a committee have questions about capacity, reality of how the school district works, etc. So let me, let them introduce themselves.

**William Bates** 25:14

Thank you for allowing me to be here as that observer and learner. I can say that. You know, we say in Falls Church, that things travel quickly through the communication grapevine, and I'm really excited, because what's been shared with me is that you all are experts in this area, and so I'm looking forward to being able to learn from you as EDD AI, good

**Steve Knight** 25:39

Morning, everyone. I'm Steve knight on the instructional technology coordinator, and I've been with the district for 25 years. So I've been here for some disruptions of, you know, internet in the classrooms, one to one in our high schools, in our schools. And now I'm happy to

**Bethany Henderson** 25:53

meet everybody, and I want to turn it over. It over because of the quick timeframe, we took the liberty of selecting a chair and vice chair to get this moving. And so among the committee members, I'm going to turn it over to them. Y'all walked in enough working out some of the logistics, because there are some specific logistics to school board and school board committee meetings that we will go through. But let these guys introduce themselves.

**John Black** 26:20

Hi. I'm John black and CEO of OFFSET3, which is a consultancy, and we are innovation and cyber security consultants. I'm also an Army Reserve Officer of cyber Warrant Officer been in the army for 36 years, and yeah, very happy to excited to be with you today. .

**Adriana Palacios Bonarrigo** 26:43

Hi. My name is Adriana Palacios. I also work for OFFSET3. I have been living in the city for 13 years. I work also with AI, quite a lot cyber security, and I have deep roots in deep roots in the city, I have been president of the Falls Church volunteer fire department for for a while now. My turn ended last August. Yeah, so happy to be here and co chair.

**Bethany Henderson** 27:15

We've got a great agenda for y'all today. I do want to start by talking about some of the logistics, if that's okay, of of what it means to be part of a school board committee. So as a school an official school board committee, you were bound by the same rules that we as a school board are bound by when it comes to transparency in government and Sunshine laws. The State of Virginia is fairly strict. No more than two members of any elected or appointed body may convene to discuss committee matters, work matters, without it being publicly noticed as a meeting. So as a practical matter, that means three of you cannot go, you know, meet up, you happen to meet a giant and start chatting about committee stuff. This also extends to email, text, Google Docs, Miro boards, any sort of collaboration we can you can broadcast to the entire committee. Hey, committee, here's some information I want to share. But once you had a reply all or reply to more than one member, you are violating Virginia state law. So that's number one thing to know. It is a real pain. It is not how any of us actually operate in our day to day lives or work. It is really, really important. Okay, that's number one. It does require thinking, because it's not how we typically operate. You can always email one other committee member. You can have a conversation with one other committee member, but there will be times, certainly, when these guys, and I'll talk about their role versus our role in a minute, when they send out information. You can reply to one of them. You cannot reply to both of them, and you cannot reply all. So please be really mindful of that. I know it's easy because we're all like this all the time. You can't reply all. You cannot. Let's consider a meeting. It's considered a meeting that's not publicly noticed. Number two is, this is a public meeting. The public can show up. Obviously, it's highly unlikely, but they can show up. We have to produce minutes of it. That's one of the things we were talking about the school board's attorney is, how do we manage those minutes? If you go to the school board page on the school's website, you can actually look at all the committees, and you can look at all the minutes and all that kind of thing. So there will be minutes kept of this. Any documents that we produce are FOIA able, your work notes are foible. Odds of someone foying It ain't great. But you know, maybe think about what you write down, because it is foible, right? So maybe don't like write snarky things about me or the person sitting next to you or whatever, right? Keep it on the on the committee topic

**John Black** 29:41

Are there any non disclosure constraints?

**Bethany Henderson** 29:45

No, I don't think so. Number three is our role, mine and Jared is as the liaisons for the school board. Their role is to run and manage the committee. Your role is to do the work. So we are not actually voting members of the committee, Jared and I, we are here to support, to navigate, to structure the committee, to make sure, you know, everybody's like focusing on the right directions. But this is not our work. This is your work. Your work is really, really important. The school board can't make informed decisions about policy without the work by AI policy about the work that you're doing. But, but we are also here, mostly in an observational role. Jared and I now that we set up the committee, not in a leadership role. So wanted to make that clear. Lastly, because this is a school board, good morning, because this is part, officially part of the school board, there is a requirement of in person attendance. We are limited by the state of Virginia, in the amount of virtual attendance. Life happens if you need to attend virtually on a meeting for some reason that is technologically possible, I am actually going to, for personal reasons, I'm going to have to attend virtually a couple of times over the course of this term. I'm not a member of the committee that doesn't raise any issues, but y'all are so if you need to attend virtually as technologically possible, there are some logistical there are some process hoops we have to jump through. So the sooner that you can let Jared, or I know, the sooner we can make sure it's all papered over and logistically set up correctly so that you can actually participate virtually. But as a practical matter, that's one of the reasons he asked you, like, 17 times. Can you actually come to these meetings? Because that is actually part of the requirements of how we show we can't show up virtually to school board meetings without going through multiple hoops, unless there's a state of emergency, which Tuesday night there probably will be. So we may have a virtual school board meeting, but, but usually if you ever watch a school board meeting, it's you'll see if a member is ever not physically present, there was a whole legal process we have to go through of approving their distance. And there's actually a restriction on the number of times a member cannot be physically present, even if there's good reasons, somebody's ill, whatever, out of the country for work. There's a limit on the number of times that we as School Board members do that. So all of these rules are annoying. All of these rules are put in for the protection of the public. Protection of the public. All of these rules are out of our control. If you don't like them, sorry, I can't do anything about it. You can't do anything about it. Just know that these are the rules we're all bound by. So we just want everybody to be super clear. I'm gonna turn it over to Angel,

**Speaker 2** 32:17

okay, I think we have some idea of what, what the meeting constraints are, and you mentioned that by April, we have come up with a set of recommendations, and preferably recommendations that are well positioned to be translated into policy that can be implemented and have actually impact on our our schools. We're going to focus today on getting to know you and forming a team and articulating our purpose in subsequent meetings. We'll start from with a primer on what, what can we define as AI, what is our scope of our interest, and then we'll move out on mapping values and getting to to the to the you know, articulate the purpose and recommendations. So I'd like you to each introduce yourselves, and after introducing yourself, say, what is it, if we are successful, what will it look like? What will we produce, and how will our staff, students and families experience it? Would you like to start?

**Elizabeth Chua** 33:35

Sure. I'm Elizabeth Chua. I have a second grader at Mount Daniel, I guess in terms of expertise, I'm a psychology professor, where I study cognitive psychology and neuroscience. My area of expertise is learning, memory and metacognition. I'm currently doing a detail at the National Science Foundation where I work on a variety of programs related to neuroscience, artificial intelligence and learning and serve on the AI and education working group there. I guess for me, the best outcome is if students learn how to use AI and learn to work with AI, but don't use AI to circumvent the learning.

**Tom Sabo** 34:16

Very interesting. I appreciate your background in cognitive psychology. I also did cognitive science when I was in school as well. So I'm Tom Sabo. I'm a Solutions Architect, advisory Solutions Architect at SAS. I've been doing unstructured data analysis before that was cool. So now we call it's gone through all sorts of names. Now, with generative AI, there's many more capabilities than ever before, but I think having a bit of a basis, I've been doing this kind of work for 20 years, mostly in public sector type work, is is going to be helpful here. So I bring some of that long term experience to the table of working with what kind of value can you get out of like free form text, and how can we leverage all the technology today in the context of what's already been done? I have three kids in the school district, two at middle school, and one at Meridian. And then I think what I would like to see possible coming out is a policy that, in of course, what you said, Elizabeth, but then a policy too, that can evolve with the changing technology, which is rapidly evolving with time.

**Tina Beaty** 35:23

Hi everybody. I'm Tina Beaty. I'm a mom of three in the school district. I have one at Mount Daniel, one at Oak Street and one at Mary Ellen. Professionally, I serve as the chief marketing officer for Sherm. We are a trade association and the world's largest voice on all things work, worker and workplace. There, I serve as the executive sponsor of our AI work. AI H I experience a part digital, part event research, a research initiative that we launched three years ago in order to help CEOs and CHROs really navigate the new world of how to look at your team, your workforce, how you bring in AI as a team member without entirely displacing your capabilities. We do recognize because the data is telling us, maybe more importantly, CEOs sitting in for self interest right now are telling us that they are displacing they don't need as many humans sitting at best in traditional jobs as we knew it for the last decade. So I come at it from a perspective of seeing the data, but hearing what workplace teachers need right now, what they think they need in three to five years. No one knows past that. But then also, as a mom, recognizing that I assume my children are going to need jobs, but they are out from needing their first job, and so the decisions that CEOs and CHROs right now are going to set up what the kind of economic and workforce structure looks like for our children to be around.

**John Black** 37:08

So if we get rid of all the entry level hires now, where are the frontline leaders going to be coming from three or five years from now?

**Tina Beaty** 37:15

America's first jobs are robots, right? McDonald's has now piloted and improved that so you call it AI plus HI.e

**John Black** 37:22

Have you ever used the term human, machine teaming? We have not, okay, from my domain, that's, that's one of our buzz words right now. Okay.

**Tina Beaty** 37:32

Sounds like it may be very aligned, though, perhaps that idea of integrating, so what I would look for out of this working group is something that, like you said, is modular, because it is going to need to change very rapidly. But I think we need to take in the balance of safety and the idea of preserving childhood and education as much as preparing these humans to enter a world that at the moment, they are just busy. So I think that that's going to be the unique layer that we need to put on this they are not the workforce yet.

**Thomas Colvin** 38:31

Hi, everyone. So my background is Aerospace Education, aerospace engineering. And I came to do a lot of policy stuff for the most, part of new technology policy and development is what I started in I went to the DOD for a while, while I was there, among other things, what can we do? Enterprise wide investments to set our service management up to success. Everyone was arguing about the difference between AI and machine learning. There was very strong opinions and every meeting why my definition is right. Everyone. We don't talk about ml so much, but so I that was my first, we'll say, professional experience, working with AI. And then, since I've worked at NASA for a while, support at the White House, there's a lot of national level policy, creation, technology policy is my specialty. Also quantifying the things that people say can't be quantified because it's maybe too hard or whatever. So I was at NASA, got let go because of administration stuff. Our whole office got cut, but we kept our team together and we started a sort of a boutique techno economics firm. We're doing quite well, better than we could possibly have expected, but I still feel like a civil servant, and one of the things for is, like, how do I get back into helping the community? And so I'm, you know, jealous of folks who've been leading the volunteer fire department for a long time, but like, this is my first attempt at trying to do something.

**John Black** 39:52

Sounds like a recruiting opportunity.

**Thomas Colvin** 39:54

I really appreciate the spirit of public service, right? And so now that I can't do it in the federal government for a while, I'm going to do it hopefully. Here, my experience with AI more recently is that I use it all the time for research. Specifically, it's mostly code completion, and I have a number of workflows that I can show and teach other people about how you can use AI in ways that doesn't take the human out of the loop, that makes sure that every piece of data, because I do research right, like I have to stand by every single number and every single factoid, right. And so how do you use these tools to actually improve your ability to do quality control on data, to gather better data, rather than just, you know, offloading these values. So that's, that's, that's a lot of my background, national policy, creation, technical techno economics and avid AI. My hopes for this is, as I said, I've done a lot of strategy development. I co shared NASA Space sustainability strategy. And one of the things that's really difficult when you're coming up with policies is you have to articulate what are the challenges. Like everyone wants to reap the benefits of something, but what's the problem? You have to name the stuff that makes it hard and then be able to craft goals and objectives that support that. So my hope for this is that we do not treat AI like I have seen it treated in so many other places where it's pixie dust. It gets sprinkled on problems and the problems go away. Profits are maximized and efficiencies are gained. My hope is that we can clearly articulate even the things that we hope to get out of, not just exposing but encouraging our children and our educators, and then have a causal chain that gets us from the things that we recommend to the problems that we said we were trying to address. A little bit more process lines, but values as well. I would like to, I feel like this over last you were saying I would like to have a policy that is trying to do much, much more than just make our kids more productive economic units.

**Bethany Henderson** 42:20

Did you mention your kids?

**Thomas Colvin** 42:23

Oh, sorry, I have one son.

**Anubav Vasudevan** 42:25

Hi, I'm professor of philosophy at the University of Chicago. My family, I recently relocated to Falls Church. My wife is located here. I have a son who's in first grade. So in terms of my own connection with AI related topics, I've taught several university level courses and CO taught courses with people on a variety of issues related to AI courses about the foundations of statistics and statistical inference, other courses related more to kind of philosophical issues in AI I've also participated in many recently. I've been participating in many research groups which are focused primarily on ways that AI can be used in, specifically in humanities based research, which is kind of an interesting topic. I've also been working on sort of similar issues of pedagogical reform at the university level, so thinking about how courses can be restructured, how curricula can be redesigned, with AI in mind. I'm not sure how much of that thinking will be able to be naturally transported into the K through 12 setting, but I have been thinking about these issues in that, in that connection, I guess, in terms of what I hope we can achieve, or one of the things I hope we can achieve in this community, I would like if you know, I would like it if the guidance that we ultimately provide to to the school system can help to empower teachers so that they feel confident that when they're deploying AI in the classroom, they're doing so In a way that promotes their understanding the means that we're still preparing our kids for higher education success after that. So I think, you know, I do think AI literacy is an important component of this from the teacher side. But I also I want, I want them to feel more comfortable that they know, like when it's a responsible thing to use AI creating sort of conceptual frameworks that they can, they can grapple with on maybe a per assignment per course basis, that can really help them in designing their curriculum. So I'm thinking a lot. I think about it largely from the teacher perspective, because I think they're facing a real problem, and it's not just the students, it's the teachers too. And so hopefully we can come up with useful guidance.

**Anubav Vasudevan** 45:04

I don't think you could do it without examining pedagogy.

**Anubav Vasudevan** 45:15

Yeah.

**David Berol** 45:18

My name is David Berol. I've been in Falls Church since 2007 and my background, I was a government attorney for the EPA for about a decade, and then I pivoted into data science, and I was data scientist for the College Board. So that's that whole process I was introduced to working with AI and programming, and I admit that I completely misjudged generative AI when I first saw it back, you know, you know, six or seven years ago, I thought it was a toy and it would never amount to anything. So that was a failure of judgment.

**Speaker 2** 46:02

Don't worry. Larry Ellison said there were only need for like, five or six super computers in the world Max. He missed the boat. They didn't think the internet would amount to anything either.

**David Berol** 46:11

Yeah, when I first saw it, it was just producing, like, silly little stories. And, you know, it's amazing how much has progressed. I'm the parent of three kids that have gone through the falls, church, city schools, or my youngest is just finishing up. She's a senior. My two older kids are both CS majors in college, dealing with all the future employment issues that are being created by generative. Ai very familiar with how incredibly useful it is for coding assignments, and I'm persuaded, yeah, for coding work, it's just part of the essential workflow. And there are some really interesting issues about balancing the productivity, you know, relevance of AI, with what seems to be some fairly clear evidence so far of getting in the way of learning. And students are not in school to be productive. They're there to learn. And yet, at the same time, there has to be some role to see, you know, to model what they're going to be doing when they actually in the workforce. But that's not like the primary thing they're there to do. They're there to develop their cognitive and social capacities.

**John Black** 47:39

So, state that as what success looks like. Because I think there's something important, what does success look like?

**David Berol** 47:43

I think the most important thing is that the policy be practical, so that it can actually be implemented. I wouldn't want the policy to be like, Okay, our recommendation is to go study some things, right? Oftentimes, that can happen, I would hope that the more concrete the recommendations are, the better. And I guess there are a lot of values to be balanced. I can't articulate them all. One that I'm concerned about is fairness. There's a major fairness issue. There's basically a prisoner's dilemma problem, because it's so easy to cheat and you can feel eventually compelled to cheat at the same time, there are policies in place that are draconian in terms of punishing talk cheating, it can create a really mistrustful environment where the main rules don't get caught. But you must use AI. That's a concern for me, and also it's it's so much more difficult to prove use of AI than it was to prove use of to prove plagiarism. And so I'd like to see us develop policies that are going to avoid these sorts of unfairness problems that could poison the learning environment. But there are many other values. That's just one that I'm particularly concerned about.

**Speaker 2** 49:15

There's the whole paradigm of cheating based on a system which we request students to provide the answer, as opposed to Yes, provide the question and the path.

**David Berol** 49:27

And I second I forget who several people have made the observation that dealing with AI inevitably involves shaking up pedagogy, and I agree with that. I don't think it's possible to develop a to deal with AI without adjusting our notions of what's valuable to learn and how teaching is done, and so somehow we'll need the engagement of the faculty, because their thoughts are really important. But I'm not sure how that'll make sense. I'll share. Hello.

**Jillian Burkley** 50:08

I'm Jillian Burkley. Recently moved to fall church from New Hampshire. Originally from New Hampshire, lived in Colorado, came here. My husband is a country physicist. I don't know what he does, but what exotic happens? Yeah, is cool. He has had us move many times. Hopefully, this is our place to plant our roots. I currently have a second grader at Matt Daniels and then a four year old, rising kindergartner. So I'm social worker by trade. Been in a clinician for 14 years. I know I have to tell my clients many times. I know I look young like it's my genetics. Great, but I did my doctorate research creating a program for artificial intelligence for K through 12 education, particularly around a population that many of us forget about, and that is the children that live with disabilities. And the thing is, every child can access a disability throughout their life. It could be a kid who's playing football get the concussion. They need a 504 because, you know, they cannot do the reading, they can't look at the screen. They have to heal their brain. And so special education is not just because, oh, our child was with autism or having behavioral issues. And so the program that I have designed, of course, is not yet a framework, because it has to go through a lot of like, you know, more research, and put up a pilot up for that, but it is designed to really look at the injust and making sure, again, that human connection approach is always there, yet looking at this as a human so as a social worker, working as a clinician, is for adolescents and children with families. For many years, I've always worked with schools. You kind of can't get away from a school system when you're working with a child, and I've seen all the things that in that learning component with a child, regardless of the demographics, and how to again, use this tool to continue to evolve with our educational system. Education, our educational system United States is like the oldest system working somewhat well, and we have, like the best data on our citizens, on this information, and yet, I feel like there's a lot of gaps we have not really looked into deeper to really understand, to enhance that learning. I am definitely a believer that we don't want to be codependent on this. I have learned, if you know what, had Verizon a couple weeks ago, that I was very good opinion on my GPS again. I moved here, but it was a very first time I had to, like, study a map to get to my place. There was no cellular call service. It was a great panic moment, but it was also kind of exciting. I was like, Oh, back in 1996 here, so I'm trying to think again, like, I guess my vision and success is that our committee is going to look at the whole child in regards of you know, just like our not our star students, but also our students who need that extra support and labor and also that teaching our Children about like it is okay for others to maybe use a tool that may seem unfair, but how do we teach them to be responsible, and that, you know, citizenship of being responsible, as you know, with their digital usage and everything, as well as creating a platform for parents to also Learn, I see children, everyone, as light followers, and so this is opportunity to continue that.

**Susan Nelson** 53:48

I'm Susan Nelson. I've been in and out of Falls Church City because of my husband's work at the State Department. So we're here to stay through high school. Now I have a junior high and a high school. Sons just got here, I guess middle of last year, last school year, I work in the software space. I sell software to nonprofits specifically to help them with their fundraising. And so we've been using a lot of AI internally to help in the sales process at my company, and that's been very interesting and enlightening and amazing actually, for me to be able to access so much more information and to make sense of it so much faster when I'm interacting with a client or preparing for a client meeting. So it's been really interesting internally, and now as a software company, we're developing AI solutions and introducing them to the nonprofit space. In particular, I've been part of a team that is looking for early adopters within our own client base to test out an agent that is a fundraiser, and so it sits inside our system alongside decent fundraisers and interacts with donors and potential donors, and it's been very interesting to see the reactions, and we're working on the proof points and learning what the what the risks are, and it's so that's that's my world every day. And what I hope that we get out of this is certainly a policy that can that can scale and be flexible. I think exactly what others said. We don't even know what what the next six months will look like, let alone, you know, a few years from now. So hopefully a team doesn't have to be coming back all the time to look granular, granularly at things that we've written that don't fit, you know, nine months from now or two years from now, of course, they'll have to be revisited. But flexibility in what we produce is important to me, and I think ultimately, the greatest outcome that will come from this is an excitement on the part of the teachers and the students to use this for learning, specifically to learn more, to learn at their own pace, to cover more material, to lean into things that interest them. I think the teachers will be empowered if we do this, right to really flex for the students, to cover more material, potentially, but to cover it in more unique and creative ways than we've been able to do before. So that's that's what I'd hope to see. Can we use some

**Speaker 3** 56:23

Yes, you can, that's why they're here.

**Adriana Palacios Bonarrigo** 56:31

But so did I know that you are involved with a volunteer fire?

**Susan Nelson** 56:44

Yeah, my son wants to be a firefighter,

**Bethany Henderson** 56:44

while John's handing that out, Jared, and I've been so impressed with all of you and everybody that we met along the way, really appreciate and I can see Steve really appreciate all of you contextually, just to know a couple of you raised, you know, where Are we getting input from teachers and things like that? Things like that? I want to make sure that y'all kind of have the scope of the work that's happening on parallel tracks. So this committee, what we're really hoping y'all will do is provide recommendations and ultimately help us write a policy that is informed with relevant Best Practices general public input and learning from other school districts. There are parallel tracks happening in the district right now, so you don't have to do everything, everything, everything under the sun. William has been leading a staff working group, staff and teacher working group, and he'll share some updates of where they are at with y'all to get input from faculty and staff. There is also a student group that Dr Dade, our superintendent, is facilitating, to get student input. There are standing school board committees, a half dozen or so on different issue areas, business and education, special ed, advanced academics. There's a handful of others. We have asked all of them to share recommendations about what should be, how we should think about AI from the perspective of their specific subgroup of the population, PTAs, as well, band boosters, athletic boosters, whatever, all of them have been invited to do that as well. As part of this committee's work, we will be hosting a school board to public town halls in the next four months, we would like you all to attend, not so much as speakers, because you get lots of chance to speak, right? But as listeners, as people who encourage your friends and neighbors and people you meet at the bus stop or whatever to come and show up and voice their their concerns, interests, needs, whatever, so that y'all can intake that and synthesize that as well on the first April school board meeting, which I will find the date in a moment, but we meet but we meet the first and second and fourth Tuesdays of the month, 14th, 14th. Thank you. That is going to be the school board meeting dedicated to AI, in which all of these different recommendations will be coming together, including the recommendations and sort of policy framework put together by this committee. I strongly encourage you, if you can, to attend that meeting, because that is where you will attend. It virtually. So you can, you can stream us live every two, you know, second, fourth Tuesday, if you're bored. But I would encourage you to think about attending that meeting in person or virtually if you can, since you can get the, you know, real time input, because this committee will then quickly turn to synthesize all of that into a proposed, actual policy, the policy making process. What happens is then the full the policy goes to the full school board for first reading in public. Again, that's been at a school board meeting. It's discussed public that has a month to weigh in, and then if the school board is ready, it will do the second reading, and approval would be the following month. That can also get delayed if there are things that we need to intake whatever right, but that's kind of just the process of policy making in the district, and kind of the frame and the scope of responsibility. Before I turn it back with these guys, I just want to make sure William has a chance to share with the staff and faculty arrests.

**William Bates** 1:00:07

Yes, please share it. So I'll actually turn it over to Steve who, who will kind of walk us through a document, maybe take 10 minutes.

**John Black** 1:00:18

as this is going if stuff comes into your head. I tried to jot down some of your ideas. There was a, there was a an idea behind the colors, the competing values, framework, if anybody's familiar with that, but we don't have to stick to that. I just wanted to throw some spaghetti up on the wall, because eventually a purpose will emerge. But please continue. So if you cap those ideas, start jotting them down, and we'll throw them up there as well.

**Steve Knight** 1:00:48

So, when open AI emerged. It was definitely a challenge for our secondary everyone. You know, there were a few kids. They were discovering chatgpt And so as I just wanted to kind of help you understand what the work we've been doing since 2023 one of the things that I'm really proud to share is that in 2023 we started having conversations about academic integrity at the secondary campus, and very quickly We merged together a committee of our best and brightest teachers to really talk about how we're going to address AI in the academic integrity space. We actually came up with policy that, in few not only supported parents, but also kids and teachers. And in 23 we have IB. Since we're at IB school district, we're required to have IB world policies, and one of them is academic integrity. And that was really focused on. You can use AI for this much, and then once you get to that part, you got to use your human mind. And so we were proud the fact that we didn't shut it down, we didn't lock it down, we didn't tell kids you couldn't use it. Even in 23 our educators realized this is our new space, our new normal. So how do we guide students and teachers? So that's really where this work started. After that, we started working on something we call the compass document, where we were really bringing education school leaders together to build kind of a guidance document. We were taking that kind of marching we were seeing other superintendents and other districts doing that to help their community understand how we were going to adopt AI. And so as we were creating this document, one of the things we decided to focus on was making sure that our core values were in it, and our three core values that we really focused on was personalized learning. We see this as an intersection of providing personalized learning, allowing students have access to it to help personalize their experience. And so that's why a lot of teachers get really excited about building custom chat bots or custom projects to help them kind of navigate that space. The other thing we've been really focused on, and I live in the world of career technical ed too. I'm a coordinator of us our career technical program. And so we are thinking about workplace and college readiness. How are they going to be ready to use these tools? I have a daughter who is a sophomore at JMU, and she's navigating that space right now in AI, having that, you know, trying not to use it too much and get, you know, caught using it. And I think one of the biggest things our compass document really alludes to is this culture of integrity. That's really where we want to take it to the kids and even teachers. As Dr did has mentioned several times, it's not just about student academic integrity. It's about professional integrity. How are our teachers using it in a transparent way? How are we setting expectations for our kids? So our compass document includes that, like I mentioned, in May 2023 we created the academic integrity policy. In 2024 we started our first AI Advisory Committee, Student Advisory Committee at the high school. We brought all to get all the early adopters that really wanted to flex how well they are using AI, but we are really hearing what they were talking about and what they were seeing is going to be the dangers of their their classmates. What are they what are the challenges going to be? We continue to have focus groups all the time. We have a lot of we've had two major focus groups. One was a parent coffee. There was a panel with teachers and students. It was amazing information. And then in 2025 Dr Bates had us start our first AI cohort, which included principals and other instructional leaders from all the schools. That's when we started to really hone in on this document. This document, the compass document that we're revising, is going to also have guidelines for PD. Right now we created a readiness survey for all our staff, and all our staffs are taking it right now. We're ready. We have to get the report cards out today. But after we get the report cards out at the elementary schools, we're going to start surveying our elementary teachers, and the goal was to measure their AI readiness in several domains that would lead to professional development. One of the domains, of course, is academic integrity and professional integrity, part of the survey is just an overall readiness of how people are feeling. And so we have really great data at the secondary school. We're actually using this data to already do professional development. So our early release Wednesdays, we have PD on technology and AI this readiness scale helps them group into where they need to be. And I get to sit with all the know it alls who are the leaders who demonstrated a great understanding. And then we talk about bigger picture kind of things. The last thing I really wanted to touch on with the compass is that we're focused on thinking first tools second. So we definitely have to keep the human loop in and remind teachers. I think there is a lot of teachers are seeing this as an efficiency thing where maybe this could help with grading and feedback. So we're really trying to help teachers understand that we can't replace all feedback with AI. Kids still need to hear from you. Kids still have to have your interactions. Maybe we just have to figure out a better way of doing that. And so we have a couple tools that we've already pushed out in the secondary that gives some feedback, but then that gives time for teachers to actually have personal reviews and interviews with kids to find out if they really know what they're submitting. And as I mentioned it, we're not only planning for professional development next year for teachers, we're also looking at it. What do we what our students need? And we know it's going to be focused on integrity and the ethics of using AI. So that's kind of high level. What's in the document? I don't think I left anything out. You did a great job. Was I under five minutes a plus, I'm a teacher. I talk fast.

**David Berol** 1:07:38

May I just flag? Thank you for the presentation. May just flag a couple issues that jump to my mind, sure as you were speaking, number you mentioned IB, think would be in I'd be interested to learn more over time whether IB already has an AI policy that's going to constrain this school system, because IB is something I want you to look at.

**David Berol** 1:07:59

Number two custom chat bots there. I know there's broad interest in people developing chat bots. They're trying to have values baked into them, but there's some concerns about, to what extent can you really trust programming have a chat bot if you think it has like tutoring instincts baked in. The first instance, we want to do is break those instincts. And so the programming trust issue. There ethical boundaries on use. There are some really thorny issues if you try, and like, cognitively wall off certain things, because, like, say, the rule is you can't copy the words, but you can brainstorm with AI. Well, you just use AI, and now you have words stuck in your brain and, like, what if you accidentally, like, use a phrase that you saw, did you just cheat? You know? I mean, it's like, walling off cognitive processes from each other is a messy business and so easy to screw up, and it could create, like, really unpleasant learning environments if the rules aren't, like, if the boundary between right and wrong isn't clear enough, you know. And then fourth, I think teacher feedback that uses AI is a really thorny issue, because it can undermine our credibility with the students. If the teachers are using AI to provide feedback, particularly on subjective things like the quality of their own writing, because then they'll think, why shouldn't I use AI to produce my writing? If the teachers are just cheating themselves by using AI to create my writing?

**Adriana Palacios Bonarrigo** 1:09:32

Will you be sharing with us that the Compass

**William Bates** 1:09:37

I'm not yes, so yeah, so we, we will share the Compass document and the survey, the results of the survey,

**William Bates** 1:09:45

I don't know about the results,

**Bethany Henderson** 1:09:47

So they're gonna their work will also be presented. The work of this group will also be presented in April. Okay, right? So it's a parallel tracking. We just wanted to make sure y'all knew where they were, okay? So it's hard, because there's lots of parallel trains, and it's all interact related, right? So just from a scoping standpoint, think about getting the inputs from teachers, faculty, staff. These guys are doing that. Y'all are running parallel to that, right? And that is, you don't need to worry about getting the information from that subset of folks, because ultimately, for the final policy, all that's going to get integrated together, and you all be part of that. Does that make sense?

**William Bates** 1:10:19

But yes, the compass, but yes. So the compass document, it's not quite ready for public consumption, but you know, as you know, Mr. Knight shared as far back as a couple of years ago, as AI was continuing to emerge. We have early adopters. We have teachers who are asking, Well, can I use it? If I do use it, can I use it for this? If I have students using it, is it cheating? Is it so all of the complexities, and we are giving them guidance to the best of our abilities, based upon our understanding and knowledge, but then also almost daily changing of this, this growth thing called AI, and so not having a policy was something that, you know, we wanted to make sure that we're doing right by our students and our staff in their training and development around the use of AI, but also making sure we're steering students in a correct way and making sure they're also protected as far as what they may or may not be using, and then as far as the survey is concerned, using that survey to gage where our teachers are. So then we can begin building professional development. But we're looking forward to to the policy, because there are cases where teachers may have questions, or parents may have questions, and where we are right now not having that policy, we're just going on what we believe is is best practice based upon our own, you know, teaching and learning or other policies that we may have that kind of run parallel to some of the things that are happening. So that's kind of, that's kind of where we are.

**John Black** 1:12:15

So I want to give you two quick stories vignettes, and then I want Adriana to lead us through a quick exercise, and we'll follow up an email and you all respond individually, not reply all and violate the law. Over the summer, I saw a post on Facebook from one of my friends, fraternity brother, guy who was a college professor, absolutely decrying AI as having ruined his life, ruined teaching and education, because the students just cheat at everything. And his dad chimed in, he was a college professor as well. Says, Yeah, I'm glad I'm out of the business. And I responded to him individually, or when I saw him in person, I said, Why don't you change your pedagogy. Why don't you change the assignment? In a world where answers are now free, all value is with the person that is able to form the question? And he said, Yeah, I've been at this for a long time, and he's a single dad hat is off to him. And, yeah, I don't have time to just completely change the way I work. So that's one story. And then another story is I was I love school. As it turns out, of all the things I do in life, I like school the best. And I got to go to school. The Army sent me to school. The Warrant Officer Advanced Course for Cyber, and one of our blocks of instruction was advanced Python scripting. Day three, the instructor walked off the job, I can't do this. I'm not qualified to teach this course, and ran away. And he said, finish the course yourself.

**John Black** 1:14:02

Okay, I could use the AI to create tools, Jupyter notebooks with progressive scaffolding. I said, I told AI, "Don't give me answers. Teach me, and take the scaffolding away slowly until I can write the code" and it worked. I had to sink or swim. And I'm glad that the school gave us the freedom to say, Yeah, well, we can't provide you an instructor, so figure out how to get this course done on your own. So two different vignettes, and Adriana was going to, I was going to walk us through a couple things about, yeah, how this, some of the stuff makes us feel, because those things, those two stories, conjure up, you know, some emotions in me. And then we'll talk about the My User Manual, I think, which we'll have to complete outside of class, right?

**Adriana Palacios Bonarrigo** 1:14:56

So, as you can tell, AI can generate strong feelings, and among them excitement and concern. We need norms to protect candor and keep us moving. So we propose agreements such as, assume positive intent, challenge the ideas and not the people. Name trade offs explicitly not silver bullets. Distinguished concerns versus requirements versus preferences, parking lot for out of scope issues, yes and yes, but balance innovation plus safeguards. So any additions to that, and feel free to ask me twice if you don't understand what I'm saying,

**Susan Nelson** 1:15:55

Will Will this be? I feel like that's a great list, but I didn't I'm not going to remember all of those. Is there going to is there going to be part is it going to be posted somewhere, sent to us

**Speaker 2** 1:16:04

via email? Yes, and your contributions and additions and discussion will be solicited in a very serial way, because so that we can comply with the law.

**Elizabeth Chua** 1:16:16

Is there any keeping in mind all the meeting rules like, it might be nice if, oh, here's a like you said, these nice on ramp resources, it might be nice if we had access to other things like that. I find something I want to share with the group is there, like a shared drive we can put it on. Do I email you? And you may email

**John Black** 1:16:34

I have this wonderful tool called Miro, which is a board where we can use it just has to be read only for you, but we will be your Sherpas to bring your resources into the board.

**Elizabeth Chua** 1:16:47

So the protocols email you, yes. Which one of

**Bethany Henderson** 1:16:51

you two wants emails? Well,

**John Black** 1:16:55

you're so you want to name me the chair, but you're going to very quickly find out who runs the show, right? Because we're competing values. I'm big on Create and on control. You know, I'm like an engineer and an artist together. Adriana is the sage and as well as the athlete. So you know, she won't let us get out of here without some do outs and follow up.

**Adriana Palacios Bonarrigo** 1:17:19

So you want folks to email you? Yes, that's better, yeah.

**Jillian Burkley** 1:17:22

So I mentioned, like, if we find articles, we directly email you and then you will share it out to the group. Because yes, and I think what we'll do is take advantage of the fact that we can do one on one meeting. So we're all going to have lunch together at some point, one on one. Okay?

**Bethany Henderson** 1:17:42

Telephone on the school board. So, like, I'll tell Jared here, I'll call the next person, next person.

**Jillian Burkley** 1:17:47

I know, like the technology and everything we're really good at, it is fast, but is there a way where we can have, like, a space here that we can contribute and add, like a sticky note, like a board that is dedicated to the committee, and so, like, if someone in the area is like five, I'm going to drop this off and we'll just report communicating, but it's transparent, right?

**John Black** 1:17:51

Like, so you'll see, when you see the Miro board, you'll see that we're sort of on this journey of figuring out the forming part of this thing, of, why are we here, what what we would like this to the outcomes to be. And then we get to the point of of what some ground rules should be, what's in, what's out, I'll be another exercise. Another one is my user manual. I mean, it's like, just you. It's like, Hey, don't call me before eight, because I haven't had my coffee, and life is bad, right? Or, or I really thrive on working, you know, at odd hours, I'm, you know, very inspirational. Whatever it is, whatever you or I like people who explain things to me in detail, or I don't, I'm very sensitive to criticism my user manual. Now we could probably best do that offline, right where you could just, you know, talk about that, because it helps us, helps us all respect each other and and get the most out of one another's Another thing I'll ask you to do is to take the assessment for your IG Nome and to find out maybe you already know of of what Your dominant logic is in terms of the competing values, right? Create, control, compete, collaborate, they're all important. And in fact, the process that we want to implement is one that deliberately puts these values into conflict with one another, and there will be friction, and it will sometimes it will seem like we're going backwards, right? But in fact, we're producing a much better outcome, because it's one that that we're all these values are able to impact our product and and hopefully that will also you'll, you'll come away feeling more engaged and that we we that it's an inclusive process which we have to respect it within this group and then with our larger group at the school board and the public as well, we are actually accountable to the public. So where are we now on this journey here?

**John Black** 1:19:57

Wait, I think I can send this by email. It's just fill out your fields purpose of what we have already discussed, just in inviting and I can send an email and they can reply to me right with with the answers. I also maybe it would be a good idea. I don't know if you agree to have a vision or a mission for as a committee and to form that maybe by next week, or by whenever we're meeting next

**Jillian Burkley** 1:20:32

even though I think you know so we don't inadvertently like send an email. I don't know if you can add in your signature and bold do not reply all just as a continuous In addition, we do okay. And then in addition, I know we have to have transparency as we collaborate. But there's so many bright minds here, and I'm sure we have so many fun ideas we want to rattle off. So would there be the contact list to connect yet. Of course, I understand how we have to do

**John Black** 1:21:03

well, we've got each other's emails, but that's about it. Some of those emails have names, plain names, attached to them. Others don't. So it would be great if we had that entirely so, so they can, like, sit on a form. I think what will as I'm thinking about it all right, if we want to just take the email risk off the table, we'll create a web form. Yes, do that. So we had, we're having a discussion at the lunch room, lunch room, the table, the family lunch table last weekend, and Xavier said about that, I think we should talk about allowance. I'm like, Oh, really. And then we said, Well, how about we talk about your chores and your responsibilities too? And then the outcome of that discussion was, by the end of the day, we had an app, yeah, that tracks their chores. They report their completion, and some chores require proof. Some others that you just have to touch your note. There, there's points assigned, there's bounties. They can self nominate, if they think that's a test that needs to be done. And they can actually, you know, propose negotiation on and the split, and the money gets split between savings, spending and giving, and so that AI, I'm not gonna lie, AI, was used to build this app, and it's up and running with our beta testers, namely us. I also asked another suggestion,

**William Bates** 1:22:59

This is definitely a multi purpose room, and so not only do we have our board work session daily, the other question I would have, if there's a will, there's a way, and so If it's some sort of portable board, the other question, would be having a display as were you also have members of the public, oh, and more.

**Jillian Burkley** 1:23:53

So it's about just other avenues of our creativity and curiosity, and then when we talk clearly on topic and hold ourselves accountable, but also the integrity of my football team. Stateofficials, we were formed as the AI Policy Committee and given the tools of the stone age to complete the task.

**John Black** 1:24:19

So spoiler alert, I'm gonna take a picture of this, and I use AI to say, okay, what are our dominant themes here? And put it out to you.

**John Black** 1:24:33

[When asked what AI do you prefer to use?"] I've got so much context in chat, GPT, I started using Codex for coding, but I very quickly started like getting enamored with Claude and the anthropic models, but I use all the models. And actually, the models are more of a commodity. It's agentic behavior that is harder to achieve, and it made me and I like cognitive studies as well, but it made me decompose cognitive pipeline, because I had to to figure out where the gaps were in my agentic reasoning, so from curiosity to attention to memory to retrieval to reasoning, basic reasoning, critical thinking to metacognition to executive function. And I probably missed a step or two. But I, what I found on this, this continuum, is that AI is really good on the front end, and it gets progressively not as good as you get out, and then requires more the human team could actually get it to the results that you want. But you can actually, you know, because we're all smart people, you can decompose things.

**Adriana Palacios Bonarrigo** 1:25:47

If you want, you can send anybody. Can send me whatever ideas you have figured out how to put it. I can post it on the Miro board. We'll share it with you, and we can have like spaces where with your name, all of the things that you have been sending me and so on. We have like, individual boards for each one of you. And yeah, so it's really cool, and we're excited to work on these.

**Bethany Henderson** 1:26:11

Time is it a premium for everybody? Yes, the Stone Age workaround is y'all can schedule more meetings. So, I mean, that is a possibility. They need to be scheduled in advance, or extended in advance, or whatever minor details that can be managed. But if y'all find that you need more time, because this is a compressed time frame that is possible,

**Adriana Palacios Bonarrigo** 1:26:28

and you said it is okay to send minute, minutes, yes, meeting minutes. Sorry, yes.

**Bethany Henderson** 1:26:32

And I actually sent you guys, there's some process we're doing something about approving minutes and things, but yeah, so meeting minutes, you know, but it is Stone Age tools. It's interesting when I get frustrated with the school board of the council. Just know like, thank you.

**Bethany Henderson** 1:27:01

I emailed Joe all of the committee orientation, materials, background, and then also the initial framing, scoping document that we put together. It's a very high level, right? Just sort of like, here's kind of how we see the purpose of the charge to the other committees. So you know what we've asked them to do specifically. And then recap with the public statement that we made. So you have all of that. So I know it's kind of coming after the fact, but thank you.

**John Black** 1:27:30

Did you have any idea when you were running for school board that you'd get ropedinto something like this? Why you joined the school board?

**Bethany Henderson** 1:27:39

This is not surprising. Jared and I both have, in different ways, pedagogical and AI experience that's relatively deep. As you could see, I'm actually about to get to training in AI.

**Bethany Henderson** 1:27:53

We appreciate what you've been able to put together, especially on here short notice. Have any questions? Call us.

**Speaker 2** 1:28:35

Adriana very much is able to structure and organize things better. I'm better at ideation.

**Speaker 1** 1:28:44

And then if you, if you need some technology on the next go around, let us know you have to have your school, your laptop to connect to that well.

**John Black** 1:28:54

And so, so, so I'm in the Army Reserve, which is more or less operates the same way. Don't touch our stuff, right? So, so I, I bring my projector to my Army Reserve meetings and just throw it up on a wall, if I have to, right, we can a screen, you know, could I mean, like a white screen or a wall whiteboard, if there, if one exists, yeah.
