One-page Team Charter v0.9 (update to v1.0 for Feb 6 review + in-person vote)

**FCCPS AI in Schools Ad Hoc Advisory Committee — Team Charter (Draft v0.9)**  
**Period:** January–May 2026 (8 scheduled meetings; additional sessions if approved)  
**Authority:** Falls Church City School Board (AI policy development process)

# Mission

Recommend an age-appropriate, human-centered approach to AI that personalizes learning and prepares students for the future while protecting fairness, belonging, safety, and integrity.

# Overall Project Objectives

A) **Human-centered learning + student development** — Enable AI use that strengthens learning (understanding, personalization, creativity) without replacing effortful learning or student agency.  
B) **Safety, equity, trust, and integrity** — Protect students and the learning community through clear expectations that preserve well-being, fairness, and academic/professional integrity.  
C) **Practical, age-appropriate guardrails that scale** — Provide clear, grade-banded guidance and a sustainable governance model that can adapt as tools evolve.  
D) **Teacher enablement + implementation readiness** — Ensure policy becomes practice through training recommendations, classroom exemplars, communications guidance, and friction reduction.

# How we work

-   **Meetings:** In-person, noticed meetings are the forum for deliberation and votes.
-   **Between meetings:** Members complete independent work (research, data calls, surveys, drafting input). Inputs are submitted **1:1 to co-chairs** via webform or direct email (no reply-all deliberation).
-   **Decision method:** Strive for alignment; when needed, decide by **majority vote of members present** during in-person meetings.
-   **Records/minutes:** Co-chairs maintain agendas, minutes, decision log, and action-item tracker. Materials may be subject to public records requirements; avoid including student PII.

# Roles

-   **Chair (John Black):** Facilitation, synthesis, drafting, agenda design, decision logging, publication of pre-reads.
-   **School Board Liaisons / FCCPS Support (Jerrod Anderson, Bethany Henderson) and Staff Liaisons (as designated):** Provide charge clarification, constraints, district context, and process guidance.
-   **Members:** Contribute to assigned focus areas and deliverables; complete between-meeting tasks and provide timely input.

# Collaboration tools

-   **Miro board:** Read-only for members; co-chairs post synthesized updates and artifacts.
-   **Email:** Broadcast-only for notices/materials; avoid reply-all discussion.
