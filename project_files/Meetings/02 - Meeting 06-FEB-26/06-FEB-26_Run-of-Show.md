1) Updated 60-minute agenda (with Team Charter vote)

# 0:00–0:03 — Adopt agenda

-   Motion + vote (quick).
-   **Chair note:** “Today we will leave with three artifacts: Definitions & Assumptions, Priority Misconceptions, Draft Grade Bands.”

# 0:03–0:06 — Approve prior minutes

-   Motion + vote.

# 0:06–0:10 — Public comment (if any)

# 0:10–0:15 — Liaisons’ updates (School Board + staff)

-   Capture constraints that affect grade bands / tool access / comms.

# 0:15–0:27 — Team Alignment artifacts + Team Charter v1 (review)

**Purpose:** show the work you did from the questionnaire; socialize changes; tee up a clean vote.

# 0:15–0:18 (3 min) — “What we learned” lightning summary

-   3–5 bullets from questionnaire synthesis (patterns, not individuals).
-   1 slide or 1 Miro frame: “What this changes in how we work.”

# 0:18–0:22 (4 min) — Walkthrough (high level)

-   Team Alignment Map (30–60 sec)
-   Team Contract (60 sec)
-   Roles & Leads (60 sec)
-   Team Charter v1 changes vs v0.9 (60 sec)

# 0:22–0:27 (5 min) — Team Charter v1 discussion + vote

-   Prompt: “Any must-fix edits for clarity/scope/decision method?”
-   Park “nice-to-haves” unless truly material.
-   Motion: “Approve Team Charter v1 as committee operating charter.”
-   Vote + record.

Where it “fits” in the standing agenda: It’s a **Decision** that enables the focus work. Putting it at the *front* prevents procedural churn later.

# 0:27–0:50 — Focus block (Shared baseline: capabilities/limits + classroom reality)

Goal: produce the three “leave the room with” outputs.

**Structure:** 3 sprints + 1 quick converge.

## Sprint A (0:27–0:34) — Common vocabulary (Definitions + Assumptions sheet)

-   In-room method: small groups each own 1–2 terms, then reconcile.
-   Terms to lock (from your outline):
    -   “AI” (general), “generative,” “reasoning,” “tool vs tutor”
    -   “copilot vs autopilot”
-   Output contribution: definitions + 3–5 assumptions (e.g., “AI output can be wrong/confident,” “models vary,” “district tools differ from consumer tools,” etc.)

## Sprint B (0:34–0:41) — “Myths to kill” → priority misconceptions

-   Prompt: “What are the 8–12 misconceptions that will hurt implementation unless we address them?”
-   Include your starting set:
    -   “glorified search”
    -   “detectors solve integrity”
    -   “AI is always wrong/right”
-   Output contribution: ranked list (top tier vs parking lot)

## Sprint C (0:41–0:47) — 3 classroom scenarios + quick grade-band implications

-   Scenarios (from your outline):
    1.  student use
    2.  teacher use
    3.  assessment integrity (quick triage)
-   For each: “Allowed / constrained / not allowed (default)” + “What changes by grade band?”

## Converge (0:47–0:50) — Grade-banding decision (draft)

-   Decide the **structure** (not every detail):
    -   PK–2 / 3–5 / 6–8 / 9–12 (or whatever FCCPS prefers)
-   Output contribution: “Draft grade bands for policy guidance structure” (one line each)

# 0:50–0:57 — Decisions made + action items + parking lot

-   Confirm **what was decided**:
    -   Team Charter v1 approved
    -   Definitions v0.1 approved (or “published as working draft”)
    -   Misconceptions v0.1 approved (or “working draft”)
    -   Grade bands draft selected
-   Assign owners for between-meeting refinement of each artifact.

# 0:57–1:00 — Confirm next steps / adjourn

-   Preview: between-meeting “Top 3 risks + top 3 opportunities” intake.
