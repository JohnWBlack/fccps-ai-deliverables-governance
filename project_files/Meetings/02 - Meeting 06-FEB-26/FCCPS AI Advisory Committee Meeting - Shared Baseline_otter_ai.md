**John Black** 12:26

All right, so we have a full hours worth of stuff to cover and to do. And thank everybody for responding to the questionnaire, some really thoughtful input, which really helped a lot in crafting the team formation documents. We have a couple orders of business that we have to do to accomplish. So you have a copy of the proposed agenda. We need everyone's help to keep me on it. Do three. So the first order of business is to adopt the proposed agenda. And there is a you'll see as I page through this, or if you've already produced the Miro board, a standing agenda model, which we adopt, the agenda we adopt the previous meetings. Minutes we have our old business is the stuff that we worked on in the previous meeting, plus the synthesized inputs that happened between the meetings. And then we really present that, and you'll hear from me a lot today, but each of you is going to get a chance because I've proposed that you each take lead of a work stream based on your indications of interest and demonstrated expertise. Leads, co leads, contributors, and it's all movable if your interests or desires shifts. So so you can talk to me about that, but next time, during the old business part, you'll have a chance to present and move people through the mural board, or I'll drive it either way, if it's going to get on the mural board, then you got to send it to me first. And I've actually left a place a corner for each of you to have your own stuff as you wish, and send that to me, and I'll get it posted, because there's lots of interesting things to share that I come across and that you may come across. Okay, so if so, after we complete the old business, then the new business, which is our focus block, what we're trying to tackle collaboratively in this meeting, is about a half an hour. And then after that, we'll we'll take a vote on something, and then we get our charge for the next meeting. That's how it will basically go each time. And there's a flow chart so that of a sequence of inputs and processing that will get us aligned as a team, aligned with the values and priorities, identify opportunities and risks, and then get into policy drafting, and then get it ready for delivery. So that's kind of the basic run of the whole project through through April. So anyway, do I have can we? Can we just do a voice vote? Or voice votes? Okay, on the proposed agenda. All right, all in favor of adopting the proposed agenda. Say Aye. Nays the ayes. Have it Okay? Let's see here.

**David Berol** 15:56

You each have, okay, any public comment? We don't have any public here, but if they were here, they would be very welcome. Oh, we do. Oh, yeah, you're public. Any comments? What's your name? John Lewis, Okay, welcome. And do you want to introduce yourself? Say anything about your connection? Well, I just

**John Lewis** 16:24

thought it'd be interesting to hear what's going on from tech recently, okay,

**Jerrod Anderson** 16:36

my attempts to retire have failed miserably. Wish you well and you. I am John. It's in and I'm curious to see where this policy goes. So are we? Yes, excellent. We're really happy to have as much participation as possible. Tell your friends. Okay, so everybody had you have? You have handouts? Scare up some handouts for them, because we're going to do some collaborative work templates that I'm using. This is kind of an overview of the team formation, some of which we were able to complete at the end of last meeting. And then process some of the inputs that you're starting with, everyone introducing themselves and talking about what what success looks like for this committee that was with some of the first inputs. And then these are some things that either you jot it down, or I jotted down when you said it that that describe what that success looked like. So some of the first processing was just to cluster the themes and to tease out maybe version 0.1. Of objectives, because then what we did is we we sent out a questionnaire which asked you, in a little bit more depth, who you are, what's important to you, how you align to the team. The responses to that questionnaire you can view on the mural board. I don't know if I told you how long it was going to take, just a few minutes of your time, but the average time was 53 minutes, and it took us 11 days we should it would have been nicer, nicer to have collected these responses earlier, to give me more processing time, instead of my having to spend the entire day and night last night getting it together, because I like time for reflection to see here, afraid I'm going to press the wrong button. So interesting, I had there was comment that came in through, was it yesterday? David, he said that maybe scalable is not what we're after. If scalable means scaling to the world, right? It really our scope is the city of Falls Church, not anything bigger, although it's got to scale to that from classroom to the school, to the school system, but really, maybe something we might be after is flexible and adaptable, given that we're operating on the background of sweeping and rapid change, and so we would like that our work here to be still be relevant, at least in another year's time, right? But maybe I'm not sure I'm even bold enough to say that it would last five years. This is you, from what I scraped from the internet, your LinkedIn profiles, except David. This is social media silent, which is okay, maybe advisable. After all, the I included some of our non members, right our school board liaisons, Jared and Bethany, as well as Steve Knight, William Bates and Patricia, who are staff here. But since they were here last week, I put them in here recovered this. You'll get a flavor from some of the summaries that I threw. So everybody here is a parent or guardian of a student in the Falls Church schools. Now maybe it was some confusion about how to respond, but two of us also are AI professionals or report as such, and one of us reports is just as a community member and how meaningful that is. But this is just just a survey of some of the relevant expertise. There's a ton of expertise here, from academia, industry, government, all sectors are represented here, really diverse and highly educated group, and I'm really privileged to serve with you. When I asked you about your commitment of time, after you said, I can do 60 minutes in between meetings, after you said, I could do 90 plus minutes, whatever you can do is great. It's actually time is less important than the quality of the thought being responsive and being, you know, adhering to the values is the most important thing. There will be assignments of leads we talked about. So we're not having a co chair, although, you know, you'll see, I need a handler. For sure, you can all help with that, because I propose you to be leads of work, streams, leads, co leads and contributors. If I didn't get that right, or you want a different job, just let me know, and we'll make it happen, but you'll have a chance to lead the group at different times. You how. So we couldn't even agree on how we agree. Yeah, right, which I thought was funny, but, but what it came down to is, you know, it depends, right? The we don't have the same decision matter method for every kind of decision. It wasn't hard to adopt the proposed agenda, because there really wasn't anything controversial in it, right? So, am I supposed to have this microphone?

**Jerrod Anderson** 22:48

It is on. Green light means okay, red light means off.

**John Black** 22:52

yeah, it's the opposite where I worked last week. So essentially, you know, you'll see is we've got a a model that defaults to consent and then escalates as necessary. All right, so this is all from your inputs, right? This is the first pass, and so I'm not going to try to dwell on this, because we really don't have time. You have time you can peruse it on the Miro board, or if you have issues with it or want to tweak it, let me know. But what we're trying to do right,

**John Black** 23:29

we have to produce something that is ready for the board to vote on, and it includes things like acceptable use, academic integrity, governance, access and equity, privacy, data security, how it actually rolls out in a practical way, and not just a document that sits on a shelf somewhere and getting the fam, our families and communities involved, getting as many stakeholders, you know, input, as we can, so that this, this policy truly represents us. Yeah, what? What we've got in terms of commitments, it's, it's designed to be a collaborative, inclusive process. I was thinking this morning. I have one of the charts I have up here that I'm not going to present, is that innovation cycle of set a high quality target in this deep and diverse domain expertise, take multiple shots on goal to accelerate failure and learn from experience and experiments. But in the shower, I have my epiphany. It's like, oh yeah. It's like, when I was an artillery Lieutenant a long time ago, where the digital stuff, the way they locate and call for fire and targets now, is shoot a laser at it, and, you know, and a guided munition comes on it. But back in the day, and what I went to war with was a pair of binoculars, a map and a compass. And in order to put fire accurately in any place, you have to first know where you are and then try to describe where the target is. And those two things are rife with possibility of error. And in order to reduce the area, to reduce uncertainty in what we have to do and how to do it, we used a process called bracketing reading. I put the first shot out there and it lands. It either lands long or short, left and right. The left and right is easy to correct. The long and short is harder, because it's hard to gage range when you're looking at the ground, but you can tell if it's long or short. So if it's short, I say at 800 800 meters. Why? Why that? Because it's a process. If it's long, then I say drop 400 if it's long again, I say drop 200 and what I'm doing is called bracketing that mathematically in 433, adjustments, I'll be on that target close enough. 50 meters is close enough. So by using this process of not assuming we're right, knowing we're probably wrong, we can still be bold and get to very good answers, good enough answers, and we can do that collaboratively, learning from experience and experiments. Everything we do is an experiment. So that's my little army story. Now they just push a button right? What do we have? Right? Joint resources. There's a lot of this is on the board. There's probably stuff that that you could find. Please bring them right. But we have some example policies from Arlington County Public Schools. We have a Brookings Institution study, a very in depth study, some of the online proceedings that were associated with that. It's all up there. You can find it, but there's a lot of stuff out there. There's a lot of conversations about this, and it would be great to take advantage of them. We've got, we have access to our stakeholders, which are the board the schools, to the extent it's practical, both students, some of them, are living with us. So these are all you know, resources that we can we can access...

**Bethany Henderson** 27:44

Just to remind from a timing standpoint, that this committee will be able to get some stakeholder input through town halls, but that the teacher admin and student tracks are being handled by staff, and so all of that information will come into play in April after meeting, but I don't want to spend time focusing on that until we actually get those. fantastic.

**John Black** 28:08

Yeah, that that'll be a fantastic resource once it's available to us. And that's great if, if that's going to be presented, it was mentioned a compass study was mentioned at the last meeting, and I don't think we got the clarity on whether we would be able to get access to its findings. But you're saying at some stage we will Yes, committee is the other time, right? Okay, so the joint risks, some things perhaps we want to mitigate, are scope creep. We talked about scope being falls, church, city, not farther than that. We want the inclusiveness. If we don't have inclusiveness and stakeholder trust, then we've got a policy with low relevance and low adoption. Got to keep to our deadlines. We want to make sure all the voices are heard, especially, you know, folks that are or less dominant or less assertive. We want to make sure that those voices come out. And yep, I think this is just reiterating we want decision maker buy in privacy and security concerns in the policy itself, as well as the you know how we produce it. We're an open and transparent process. All these meetings are public, so we're not sharing things that cannot be released to the public here, right? Which includes proprietary or personal information that would be difficult. All right, so moving along. So these are the proposed work streams, leads and CO leads, and we don't have time to go through them in depth, but just to say what they are, research and shared baseline, which is the focus block of this meeting. I propose Tom and Elizabeth lead that. And in next week, you know, we'll, we'll be collecting some more inputs, and then you'll, you'll propose, or you'll do some synthesis and present policy recommendations and drafting. I'm nominating David, and I will help him, and a number of other contributors are listed here as well. You may see your name if you want to add, if you want to work on everybody's going to get a chance to work on everything, right? But, and remember, we can't meet more than two people outside of here, so a lead can talk to a co lead, but you can't bring a third except in this meeting or solicit them one on one. You it, and I'm not telling you how to collect information and inputs. I used a Microsoft form. A Google form would have been the same thing, right? It was a convenient way to remove the temptation of Reply All and get the kinds of inputs that I needed. You're I'm happy to help you set that up if you don't know how to do that, or you can come up with your own means, and that's fine, too. Data, privacy and security. Jillian, yeah, yeah. And I get roped into security a lot, so I'm happy to help Tom equity and access that could fits. Thank you. Tom Sabo, Thomas Halton, is wherever I go. Yes, I'm sure it does. In fact, the AI for Microsoft forms, kind of, you know, kind of aggregates and gives you a word cloud of the responses and says there were two Tom responses to the first name. Wow, that's exciting. I know who they are, okay? So equity access Tom and Elizabeth communications and community input, Tina Adriana and it has a suggested next deliverable and the dependencies. So there is, there was a time sequence to this. Is a flow to this. So you're, you might not be the focus block for a few weeks, right, but you can certainly be thinking about it now. Implementation, and change adoption, Jillian and Adriana, and I'll definitely tell you I had aI help me right. Analyze who you are, what you said and and where you were in, what you indicated, you know is your areas of interest and try to find a good fit. So AI doesn't always do a great job, but it can be very thorough. All right? How we make the decisions? If on most things good enough to try? Let's let it go. Everything's an experiment, right? When something is high stakes or critical, decision will reach for consensus, and that consensus is not is a moving target as well, right? What is consensus? Everybody you know in general agreement or not. If it's if it's closure we need, and we're time bound, we may have to go to a vote, right, and maybe a super majority could be seven out of 10. Six out of 10 will determine right. We want everybody to remain engaged and not feel like that. They're having something pushed through, you know, without their, you know, without their input, and without, you know, truly reflecting on it. There was this exercise called my user manual. It's about you and what makes you know you effective and and you all gave us inputs that synthesized inputs were, I was, you know, really, there are things that everybody wants, clarity and accountability and relationships, those are all smart things to have. I was looking for outliers that were going to be kind of showstoppers, and I didn't find any. And and you can look at these things on your own right, but I quoted some of you, except where You asked for to have your inputs anonymized.

**John Black** 34:51

Okay,

**John Black** 35:02

okay, all right, we already went through that. Now, all that then gets synthesized into a team charter. So at the end of last meeting, we had enough for what I would call the v dot 0.9. That's this one here on the left. After processing the inputs and crystallizing them in values and in operating principles, then we're able to get to a nominate a v dot one that we'll vote on the values of integrity and transparency, psychological safety and respectful challenge, equity and inclusion, clarity and focus, evidence and practicality, accountability and follow through, learning and mindset, iteration, adaptive and future ready. Nothing really controversial, but something we need to keep our eyes on, because it you know, so not to fall short, breaking it down into five areas, decision making, how do we reach alignment? We already covered it right? Kind of, you know, related to that. How do we resolve conflicts? What tools we use? No listening, open communication, trying to stay positive, right? And assume good intent was mentioned more than once, and use mediation, if necessary. What we want it? We want to remain harmonious and productive to the max extent possible. But at the same time, I think I mentioned constructive conflict, or creative conflict, which is, you know, comes from this differing values that we have, which are not a bug. They are a feature of us having different values. I mentioned, create, compete, control and collaborate, the competing values framework. And Had you taken a self assessment to where you are on that spectrum, where where you're, where you lean, being cognizant of that and intentional will produce conflict, but it'll be there'll be productive conflict, and we'll do it in a way that is consistent with our values and respect full of one another, so that our relationships will be enhanced despite our differences, maybe because of Our differences. So let's see our stakeholders. I think we've talked about communication and tools. We have some constraints, right, but the way we overcome the constraints are by disciplined and and intentional communication within those constraints, and tying all that up.

**Speaker 1** 38:26

When you say regular updates, they're single weekly update. Is there a cadence to, I mean, we have monthly meetings, right? So how

**John Black** 38:37

well they're, they're, they're every two weeks. They're about every two weeks, okay, yeah, sorry. So yeah, the cadence will go like this. We do a meeting, right? We synthesize the things that we did in the last meeting, led by the work stream lead, right? And then we come to a vote on whatever work product came out of that, then we do a focus block, and the focus block is collaborative. Involves sticky notes. It's messy, right? And we're and we're collecting and then that goes away out of this meeting with a charge for what's next, which, if you didn't hear it here, then you'll see it in email of what your next input is. I will try to maintain a cadence of, okay, we get out of here on Friday. I want the inputs to the next tranche by that following Friday, all right, and then I'll have a week to synthesize in the CO leads right of the work stream, and I have a week to process that, and then we'll get back here, and we'll do it again, and then eventually we're converging on policy and drafts and then production and delivery of policy. This is an interesting document you should read on your own, but it's, it's kind of the characteristics of functional and dysfunctional teams. And it will be kind of, you know, funny when you say, Oh, I know some bad teams like that. I've been on them. So last this is two weeks ago. This is what the draft charter looked like. And here's what I'm proposing now, and I'm going to ask you to adopt it without a lot of I mean fanfare, because you know, most of this I processed from your asynchronous inputs. Our mission recommend an age appropriate, human centered approach to AI that personalizes learning and prepare students for the future while protecting fairness, belonging, safety and integrity. Five objectives, human centered learning, safety, equity, trust, integrity, practical guardrails that scale and implementation readiness. Does that go faster or slower? No. We need to move on. Okay.

**Speaker 1** 41:03

Can I make a motion to change a word?

**John Black** 41:07

Yes.

**Speaker 2** 41:07

Can I change in the mission from personalized learning to enhance learning?

**John Black** 41:12

Any discussion on that

**Speaker 2** 41:15

there so there is the evidence on whether all learning should be personalized is really not clear. There's definitely advantages to having kind of mixed groups work together, to have students exposed to struggling and seeing where other students are at. And I think having personalized in there kind of narrows the scope too much when the

**John Black** 41:46

evidence any other viewpoints on that.

**Speaker 3** 41:52

John, I see why we're on the same research team. I also have some issue, but more broadly, right?

**Speaker 3** 42:02

Is the mission and the objectives? What are these for? Is this the mission for our group? This is, this is the team charter. Okay? So this is not, say the objectives of the strategy. This is not the policy, good, okay, this is us moving as a team, forming as a team, to to write a policy that is aligned with our team values as well as the mission that we have been given. Okay, is that the mission is, I guess, is the question. Then the one extra bit on that is, I would like a bit more definition on approach, because ultimately, right? I mean, I guess this goes to what you guys think you can use, but are we just making recommendations about AI use in general, or what is like the final form of the thing that we're supposed to output. Because if ultimately the school needs a strategy or a certain policy document, I would, I would suggest, yeah, basically right. Like, are we just creating, like, a bullet list of recommendations, or is our mission to actually create that first draft of whatever would go forward so that way everyone else, all the other groups, they can, like, chime in and they see it well,

**John Black** 43:25

I think it's the first draft. That's my understanding.

**John Black** 43:28

Okay? So one, nobody's ever done it before, right? Two, we have not been prescribed a format. Three, there are work streams outside of us that are doing stuff and four using the bracketing correction technique I talked about, there's going to be a checkpoint with the school board. They're going to come back, perhaps with suggestions of revisions. If we have been listening and they have been providing guidance through their work streams right the compass project, then we won't be entirely off. We'll have a good idea by then what their expected output is, I don't think I could tell you what that expected output is right now in terms of form.

**Jerrod Anderson** 44:26

And I can go ahead and speak to that, maybe you can. And so we're not looking for a finalized policy, but the end work. So the So in April, that's kind of when things kind of really start coming, coming together, where all the all the streams are going to come and present, or at least provide the board with their recommendations. So all the advisory committees, staff students, will provide that input this, this particular committee will have been looking at AI and education from a broad perspective. Now, if you and this is kind of, this can kind of be my liaison update as well. But you know, we want you to remember that, you know, we have lots of streams going along. And so we have ESOL, we have advanced academics, we have special ed looking at this, if we want you guys looking at it from a very broad perspective. If you happen to come across something that's interesting from a very narrow perspective, great, you can see how that aligns with what is provided in April by the other teams. But we don't want you to get too bogged down and going very narrow on particular aspects, because those are being taken care of. Again, if you see something interesting and want to just kind of like, have it, have it in the have it in the hopper, ready to go and see how it aligns with what other people are saying. Fantastic. We also want you to focus on broad policy. You'll, you'll in this group, I imagine you'll probably take a look at how other districts and how other organizations are implementing AI that's very informative to developing policy. But you are not coming up with an implementation plan. You are not coming up with a professional development plan. This is to guide the schools in doing that, because we cannot, because we as a board will provide like budget stuff, but you as a group will not be determining you're going to use this particular software, and this is how PD is going to go. Now, in a broad policy, you would want to prescribe, hey, you need to ensure that teachers are getting enough PD to use the technology to perform as best as they can, but you will not be coming up with a number of hours Exactly, exactly. We're not looking for anything that prescriptive. And so in April, all those streams will come together. And then in the last meeting in I think it's April, 24 meeting that you know within that within the timeframe between the school board meeting, and the last meeting of this committee, hopefully that will have like, Y'all will kind of try to help incorporate some of those findings into into in that meeting. And the final work product will be a rough draft of some policy. It might not be what you see at first reading, but we are hoping for like, some like, it doesn't necessarily have to be, like, a complete policy. It could be like, Hey, we saw this kind of policy language, and that's something that we can use.

**John Black** 47:26

That would be, yeah, what we're writing recommendations, what the board writes this policy?

**Speaker 1** 47:30

Yeah? So our final output, ideally, is a drafted general policy, yeah,

**Jerrod Anderson** 47:37

or at least some, like, if there's some policy language and then some discussion at the end, or something like that, just as broad, general, general guidelines?

**John Black** 47:46

Yeah, I think that's what this says here. It's their recommendations and the things that are specifically out we're not we're not doing. So yes, we're doing things like academic integrity, but we're not telling them how to run discipline. We yes, we're talking we're definitely evaluating technology, but we're not making decisions about vendor selection or any of that. There's a process for that. So that's

**Jillian Burkley** 48:12

to add, you know, back to our mission. Since this is for the committee, we're using the word students, and I think, you know, on a broader range for thinking about teachers and educators, we should be using, like lifelong learners or scholars, just to make sure that we're not just focusing on one specific population as we need to recognize that we are working as the entire ecosystem of our school system. So I personally, you know, build students is just too narrow, and we could just change that. And I was remind us

**Speaker 3** 48:40

what our mission is it is that take us? Does that take us out of scope? That?

**Jillian Burkley** 48:44

And that's the question too for our team, like, does it? But we're also discussing things that teachers are going to be implementing.

**John Black** 48:51

I would love that falls church, you know, supported the lifelong learner, and not just and I would like to turn students who are passengers into drivers, exactly and right learner means someone who's outside of K through 12, like that is our remit is outside of K through 12, and outside of I show up at eight, I do whatever the hell the teacher tells me, and then, you know, two o'clock I'm gonna go play ball. And you know, I want the to my personal vision is a student who is has agency, who's the driver of their education as early as possible, and then then you realize school is an of resource that helps you. It's not your education, and

**Jillian Burkley** 49:35

AI is for the classrooms and for the school building. We do understand that our students are taking that learning outside of that building and how they're going to be implemented, and the integrity in their studies, in their homework practices and such like that. So I mean, I guess that's something for us to still formulate what that really means, and again, that key value of adaptability, so making sure our mission is adaptable and flexible.

**John Black** 49:58

Now does changing students to learners lean in that direction without the risk of going outside scope by saying lifelong learners, if so, I don't know, to kind of like foot stomp and maybe extend what you're saying. Like, is our scope really just the students? Because you have later stuff about educators? Yeah, I went to a meeting over the weekend with parents, and they're like, You guys installed the school, installed Gemini on my computer. I don't let my kids use that. I was never consulted. So, oh no, yeah. It's like, parents and broader, the Brookings Institution native, and if I the four pillars of students, teachers, parents and staff. So should?

**David Berol** 50:46

We can be providing rules for the teachers, but the driver is serving the students now, or maybe we can broaden it. But I think the issue you're raising of who is regulated is a little different from who or who is the policy intended to serve. And you're right. Jillian, you're raising the issue of is student too narrow for the population that this policy is intended to serve?

**Speaker 1** 51:18

Go ahead. I was just in my mind, the policy has to incorporate the educators and staff too, if we support staff so the teacher. So at the very least, I would say, you know, students and students, staff and educators or something. But I like the part about the parents to the community.

**Speaker 4** 51:40

Yeah, I was gonna suggest fccps Community

**Jillian Burkley** 51:47

brings it back to we are focusing on our population, not globally. Yeah, good.

**John Black** 51:57

Love it. Consensus, yeah. Mean,

**John Black** 52:04

okay, yeah, so we're so do we think we have enough agreement to vote on this, or do we need to push it thoughts just to process questions. Like, usually when you're approving a charter, you see it ahead of time, and have some time to, like, look and think and propose. So wondering, this is version, just the second version? Is the charter going to be, like, updated every week, or a couple more times? Basically, how? How binding is this decision? How seriously do we need to take it now, this is, this is internally guiding, right? So, you know, if, if, if, halfway through the process, said we completely got something wrong, then we should say that. But I don't think it should be so narrow and constraining that we can't really live with this, right? I don't think we have to revisit. We're going to learn a lot, right? And so I think a lot of ours, and we're going to talk about assumptions in the working block here, the focus block, and about disrupting those assumptions. So it's it's possible, it's okay. Do you do we want to vote on it provisionally? Like, I yeah, I mostly agree with this. Or do you want, do you want to all comment on it and give it to somebody to take a red pen to it.

**Thomas Colvin** 53:29

I guess the only thing I'm trying to sensitize us to is that previously, when I like work working groups, and you have a charter, then you're a month into it, and someone's like, Oh, I think we should do this. And then everyone else is like, No, we already agreed. This was the scope, and what you're proposing is outside of that. So if we're just like, a small, you know, agile team, and this is just like, this is our guiding principles, then great. But if this is going to be the sort of thing where in a month, we say, no, no, no, no, it didn't say this in the scope. Didn't say this in the charter. We shouldn't do that. Well, I'm not that guy. Okay,

**David Berol** 54:08

subject the proviso that it is not like a hard blocker to amendment if needed.

**Speaker 5** 54:18

I You see it as a document, we'll

**John Black** 54:31

call it a working document, in which case it doesn't necessarily need a vote. Do we agree on that? All right. Thank you. Tom All right. All right, get me back on track. Yeah. So we have to move on to the sticky notes and quickly, because Okay, so now we're on the focus block right, and today's focus block is all about our base getting a working baseline, and it's with assumptions, definitions and assumptions that work. All right, so you've got got a handout that he kind of gives you a how to you got a pad of sticky notes, and you got a Sharpie. Where's my There we go. So I could tell them what they're supposed to do. Okay, so when we all right. So when you write something on on the on the sticky note, write it big going to be this goes from left to right and follows along with your with your handout, right. This provides some instructions. I'm providing you some instructions. There are some instructions on the slide. Just write a few words really big, right? Slap them in there. There's there's more guidance on the buckets themselves. The buckets are these white pieces of paper that are taped to the window or the screen. Right. When we vote, the voting is by just putting in a.on that sticky, okay, you can vote for your own sticky or vote for someone else's. That's right, yeah. So, so the first one, so there's going to be, there's going to be, you know, sprints and rounds, right a one definitions right among these terms, write out one, pick one and write A definition that you can define, AI, Gen, AI, you the reasoning tool versus tutor, copilot versus autopilot. Attribution, expectations, assessment, integrity, detectors, and if there's something in there that you are burning to define that I didn't suggest, then define it.

**John Black** 57:41

I'll do it too.

**David Berol** 57:57

Six to eight words, Max, nice, just, just make it big, one sentence,

**David Berol** 58:03

you know, and if, and if somebody says, Well, what does that mean? Then, then tell them, right? So, so

**Speaker 1** 58:08

basically, you're just copilot versus autopilot means,

**Speaker 3** 58:13

yeah, what Does that mean to you? I I

**Speaker 3** 58:30

missed that enough.

**David Berol** 59:00

We're just supposed to do one sticky note on one definition, and we with that

**Speaker 3** 59:26

or Yes, Unless you feel like you Want to do more. You

**Speaker 1** 1:00:22

now our visitors invited to do this as well. They just don't both. Or, how does do

**David Berol** 1:00:30

you want to? Do you want to make some sticky notes? No, you are invited. Yeah, there's nothing that says that, that it's a public meeting, and so public can participate. They can say stuff. We're the only ones that can vote. I don't know. Is this just definitions, or is this, if you finish your definitions, and the next one is, let's just go ahead, right? The second one is assumptions. We are designing for. Right? One design constraint assumption, something we must treat in true as true in policy design,

**David Berol** 1:01:14

we touched on a couple of those things while we were talking about the charter.

**John Lewis** 1:01:18

Could you refresh just a couple of those? Like a good example, must include

**Speaker 1** 1:01:23

the whole community, yeah, who's, who's, who is in scope, or must be flexible, or must be things like that, who

**John Black** 1:01:32

is in scope? We talked about wanting to be flexible and adaptable. Okay, we're going to change? Is the policy going to change every year? Every quarter?

**John Black** 1:01:45

Would we get to decide that?

**John Black** 1:01:47

Well, there are some government. The government has some structure. We are an ad hoc committee. Standing committees are part of the normal cadence of the school board, and there was a seasonality to it, where they do committee work, and then they report the school board. They at certain things, and then they, you know, get a charter for the next year, all right, but we're not that. We're this until May and done, and then the school board has to determine, you know how this policy lives and who will curate it, but, but a question is, you know, is this going to be one policy, set in stone forever, or is it going to be changed a lot changing in the world? So I think that's a reason as

**Jerrod Anderson** 1:02:35

a practical matter, you all can recommend a cadence of revisiting the policy. That's what we did with the cell phone policy. Okay? And so right now, cell phone policy is to be reduced annually until, until we admit that just if

**David Berol** 1:02:49

you want to throw that out, if you think, hey, this thing, you know, it's an annual policy, then then Throw that out as your assumption. I

**John Black** 1:03:08

bless you. Bye.

**John Black** 1:03:23

All right, you?

**John Black** 1:03:44

It. The third one is misconceptions. To kill write a misconception, as someone would, you know, say, like, oh, AI, just Google. Just that's, that's a misconception, or, AI, it's you know, you can't trust anything that it says. Or AI says, everything it says is perfectly trustworthy. You i I

**John Black** 1:05:00

group you okay, the fourth bucket is classroom scenario. You choose one and write two stickies,

**John Black** 1:05:50

two stickies for just for both, for the same one,

**John Black** 1:05:55

yeah, for the same one. So the scenarios. Choose a scenario. Student, use learning, teacher use instructional and professional assessment, integrity, sorry, one sticky can be an allowed example and another, right. That's right, the two stickies are an allowed, something that's beneficial and then constrained, something we should not same domain,

**Speaker 2** 1:06:21

like student writing, and then, like, what's allowed and what's not allowed. Or like, oh, like, here's our writing case, it's allowed.

**David Berol** 1:06:31

So if you have, like, a pair, right, that go together, that's great. You know, do it that way, if you do think of two different things, then that's fine, too. I

**John Black** 1:07:02

i So on your sticky you've got to identify, you know, which of the scenarios you're talking about, And then whether it's an Allow or constraint do. I you

**John Black** 1:08:14

Two Minutes before end of I you It's

**Speaker 3** 1:09:22

okay? Okay, and one after that,

**John Black** 1:09:38

all right, the last one is, it is grade bands. And so there's step two, grade band structure. This is going to how we're going to choose to segment our population, our student teachers and maybe our staff population, right? Is it? Is it pre K to two, three to five, six to eight, nine to 12? That kind of kind of matches how our schools are, right? Or is it something different? Pre K is only included in one of those, right? Well, I mean, is, is there, is there a minimum, you know, is there a policy for pre K? Are they just playing with blocks, right? I don't know. I mean, maybe they should just play with blocks. Yeah, so that's, so that's kind of what I'm getting at here. Is, is, is not that these, it's one of these three options. It's, it's, it's like, come up with some ideas for how we should know that what, probably what we need for high schoolers is not the same we as we need for pre kindergarten, and whether we need anything for pre kindergarten as a question as itself. So however you want to express that in sickies is welcome.

**Speaker 4** 1:11:14

So we're not just voting on A, B and C. We're putting

**Speaker 1** 1:11:19

thoughts into it, saying which one we are. I think we are voting on A, B or C.

**John Black** 1:11:24

We're gonna vote right. We're gonna vote on each other stickies, right, and and just see where.

**John Black** 1:11:31

Oh, so we are doing a sticky. Yeah.

**John Black** 1:11:33

So step two is a sticky. Okay, great.

**Speaker 1** 1:11:37

And are we definitely, I mean, we talked a few minutes to go about this being pretty broad. Are we, for sure, getting into the nuances of these different fans with this broad policy?

**John Black** 1:11:49

Is it necessary? Is a question. Do we have the time? Do we have the time? Is another question is necessary? Yeah. I mean, we're going to be looking at what other school districts have done. You know what the academics are saying, what you know, all those things are inputs and that will inform us of whether or not we it can this can be in our scope, or how much of it can be in our scope.

**Bethany Henderson** 1:12:12

Well, thinking about recommending the policy needs to account for these differences or not, or goes to micro.

**Speaker 3** 1:12:25

Yes, yes, thank you for that. All right, help steer me back here to the voting. Okay? Do we need to vote? One?

**Speaker 3** 1:12:40

Scenarios. What's that? What was the rule on scenario? Yeah, so pick one, give me two. I offered

**John Lewis** 1:12:49

an alternative. I didn't think it was structured, appropriate or considering false versus Yes, thank you all

**Bethany Henderson** 1:13:18

for this tremendous work, and I look forward to continuing to collaborate.

**Speaker 3** 1:13:22

Mr. Thank you very much. Beth, okay, I feel like

**John Lewis** 1:13:40

to keep personalized versus

**John Black** 1:13:48

All right. So on each of these buckets, go ahead and put three dots on, on, on things that you want to that you think are they want to vote for. Vote for. This is not an in or out. This is not binary. This is just to get a heat map, a sense of of where people's thoughts are. So, so put so. Pick three from a definition, pick three from assumptions, pick three from misconceptions. And just, just throw them out there, as as you are, so inspired, so moved,

**Speaker 1** 1:14:25

so three dots per person, Exactly.

**Speaker 1** 1:14:39

I mean, no, no buzz word. I think that that can be too narrow. You know some of the meaning behind some of the ways personalized

**Speaker 2** 1:14:59

education helps, like everybody has to, personalized education, like everything is tailored to exactly where, like where you are and what your interests are, I think having things tailored to where you are can be beneficial a lot of the times, but it should be the only thing right. Like a wide variety of experiences, always, if you

**David Berol** 1:15:17

see a couple that are duplicates and you want to stick them on top of each other, then that's, that's how whole kids are going to

**John Lewis** 1:15:23

pick up certain things. Like, things are always personalized, just based on it's, I mean, but like, think about, I mean, you might have

**Speaker 2** 1:15:33

had experiences where you had this one teacher, if you feel like really made an impact, or you have teachers that you feel like you learn better from, and teachers you didn't learn is good for, right? And so if you, if you think about that, that social connection is really important, and kind of that influences your learning. And so a lot of these personalized learnings are driven by these apps that do, like, you know, scaffold your learning in certain ways, but like, the social connection is also really important. Also

**John Lewis** 1:16:07

really important. So it's a complicated place. The mixed groups really emphasizes that's important. That's the kind of reasons my kids tell me that kind of thing all the time.

**Speaker 2** 1:16:19

And I guess, like, one worry is, like that personalized learning. Personalized learning gets focused with individual learning. And I want to make sure that that's not the full thing that said the IB program seems to have a lot of personalized learning, so I feel like that language also came there, but like it's in a different it's in a different time too, right? That's a long standing co chairs for the equity.

**John Black** 1:17:02

Okay? So the answer, as you're wrapping this up, as you wrap your voting up, just want to try to bring this to a close. So those of you have to leave, can leave. What we've what we've got are some working definition baselines that we can use for synthesis, that that are that Tom and Tom and his co read are going to synthesize and present for the next meeting, the next focus block, the focus block for the next meeting is going to be about risks and opportunities. And I'll work with the lead and CO lead to give them the charge to collect data, and then we'll present that. That will be our working block, our focus block for the next meeting, doing like this. This is messy, and it's meant to be messy, all right, because we don't know what we don't know, and we're still learning from each other as well as from other sources. But this is a lot of great input, and it looks like we have sufficient consensus on why we're here, and so please, please go back into the mirror board if you've ever been able to access it through web browser, either they have apps and phone apps and all that as well, but you can get to it through a web browser because there's a lot in there about process and links to resources, and certainly, if you have something to to share, send it so I can post it and share it with the group through that channel.

**Speaker 2** 1:18:52

So sorry if I miss this. The work streams, what are they supposed to do for the

**David Berol** 1:18:56

next meeting? So, so not all the work streams have an Active charge at the moment, it's on this

**Speaker 2** 1:19:10

just right.

**John Black** 1:19:32

Okay, so today's focus block was the research and shared baseline. Tom and Elizabeth, all right. That Tom Tom Colvin, sorry, and and so what we've just provided are some inputs that can be synthesized, right along with their additional research, if they care to add making sure what I'm supposed to be doing with this. Okay, so the deliverable for next meeting, right? Is a briefing, if you want to, you know, display something on the screen, send me PowerPoint, or if you want to get Miro and do it that way, I can.

**Speaker 4** 1:20:19

Is that based on this stuff or outside

**John Black** 1:20:23

so these are, these are definitely inputs, but you're not constrained by that, because you're going to bring it back right, present it, and we're going to and we're going to say, yeah, like I did with with the team charter, and you're and it was based on your input, but we didn't have an in person discussion about it, except to the extent that we did at the first meeting, right? But now we've had some discussion, and you have participated in it, and we have all given you inputs. But do do these inputs get you to to that deliverable. I don't know. There's a lot of other resources on the board and that you can bring to it yourself, right? This is everything that that Jared gave us to start with, which was the class disrupted podcast, the Brookings Institution, and the live session that they had, I thought was all very helpful to me, but they're they're not the only people doing studies right Now, right Arlington, Arlington County Public Schools, tactically, those a

**Speaker 3** 1:21:40

his AI used in

**Speaker 5** 1:21:46

education, and it's like the best case scenario. I really suggest you could watch him. Who is it Khan Academy? Or founder of Khan Academy? They're launching new conmigos Like AI

**Speaker 5** 1:22:01

driven learning tool. It's really amazing. The other resource I could

**Speaker 5** 1:22:09

suggest is presidential AI challenge. My kids just finished two projects and submitted we had access to amazing AI experts like Amazon, top companies in the field are sponsors.

**John Black** 1:22:31

Those are two great leads, but I hear a lot of families. They organize groups by themselves.

**Speaker 5** 1:22:42

And groups, develop projects on their website, there are a lot of resources.

**John Black** 1:22:52

Tell us again, what that website is? This

**Speaker 5** 1:23:01

initiative about AI in education, and they have a lot of seedlings of how it should look like or what

**John Black** 1:23:12

it means, inspirational for you. This is the roadmap, right. Where are we? We're at six February. What did we do? We talked about the outputs from the first meeting, the which included what you provided in the interim and created the draft the draft charter. But we also did our working, our focus block on shared baseline. And then, between now and the next few years, Tom, Paul and Elizabeth, you're charged to draft the one page definition. You can present it any way you want, right? But then we'll vote on it, and then what we'll be doing for the next focus block is three risks and three opportunities. So that this will, you know, be slightly retrospective, and the three risk and three opportunities will be nobody has done anything with it yet, and that pattern will repeat,

**Speaker 4** 1:24:18

all right, so we need to get those things things.

**David Berol** 1:24:23

Yes, I'm gonna, I'm gonna take photos. I may feed them to some of my friends. So with that, I guess we should motion to adjourn or any further discussion, any any other questions discussion,

**Speaker 3** 1:24:42

but question and maybe your best thing. But like, in terms of how we work together, is there a problem with having a shared document, since it is just two people, we can both do? Oh, so that's part.

**Jerrod Anderson** 1:24:56

You want to share it between each other. Great, if you had a third on there.

**John Black** 1:25:01

So that's the reason for the structure of the lead and the CO lead, and that I tell you something, you tell somebody something, you talk to each other, back to me, but then somehow I get it so that everybody sees it, and everybody's voice is heard and participates. And that is a constraint that, because I'm used to working a different way that is much more multi directional,

**Speaker 1** 1:25:27

and so in the document there where you showed us who our teammates are in the process of project we're on that's on mural, and that'll tell us what our our assignment is. Is that? Right?

**Speaker 3** 1:25:38

Everything that I talk about is on mural, right?

**Speaker 1** 1:25:42

But that's the document. Different timelines like, I think only the two of them are due next week. How do you know that? Just because you just said,

**David Berol** 1:25:49

Well, I am Sir, I am certain it's on the chart. It's here. I said it, and I follow up with an email. You remember the meeting? Yeah, okay, I know it's been a couple days in a very rough weekend. Let's go over what we're what we have to do for the next week. Okay, thank you. Yeah, because, because I'm the same way, obviously, yeah, did I sign up for? What was I signed up? What was I volunteered for?

**John Black** 1:26:19

And there are, I mean, there are dependencies, right? So we can't draft, we can't be drafting policy right now, right? Because we're doing this bracketing. We're doing we're doing divergent conversation, eventually to get to convergent conversation. If we're doing constructive conflict, right, we're going to pivot back into divergent again. It's going to feel like we're going backwards, but it's really going forward. I made a motion to adjourn the meeting all those in favor. Thank you very much. No,

**John Black** 1:26:59

I'm already I'm already \$100 in the hole for an ink toner car. Yeah, I'm gonna take photos and put them on the mirror. Yeah, you can get them from there. Yeah, everything on that mirror board can be downloaded. Can be copied. You could share it with your AI friends, right? So there's, it's really useful. I'm very big on the tool.

**Speaker 3** 1:27:35

Yeah, well, we could talk first, and then I'll take pictures later.

**Jerrod Anderson** 1:27:40

All right, her to be vice chair. But she's also, like, she hasn't committed because she's not quite sure about the timeline or the time.

**John Black** 1:27:51

The big thing is this, so I, you know, I'm a big ideation guy on the on the CVF, I'm way green, but I'm also red control, but I need somebody to make sure that the rain that I'm not deviating too much from the schedule, right? And also, specifically, may need somebody to cover when I'm physically absent because I have some military duty coming up, right? And but, but that.

**Tina Beaty** 1:28:20

Thank you for your service. My dad was in the Army as well.

**John Black** 1:28:27

so it's to run the meeting when I'm not here is probably the biggest thing. But in terms of the workload, you know, having so after our conversation, I thought, I'm making everybody a co chair by giving them more extremes. And definitely the responses to the question were really helpful in that and kind of figuring out matching both the area of interest and the level of effort to so. So what you're asked, being asked to do is is not a heavy lift, unless it makes you completely uncomfortable to target in front of a group.

**Tina Beaty** 1:29:01

That I can do. I wanted to just be realistic, of I would not be able to kind of help type up a lot of the post it notes and just things like that, like bandwidth within the week would not I would not be the best person for that,

**John Black** 1:29:11
