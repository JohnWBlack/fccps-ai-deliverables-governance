# FCCPS AI Advisory Committee — Decision & Change Log

**Version:** v1  
**Last updated:** 2026-02-07  
**Purpose:** Prevent drift by recording (1) decisions and (2) changes that affect downstream work (scope, grade-band structure, enforcement posture, tool governance, etc.).

## Decision log

> **Rule:** If a decision changes an assumption, deliverable, owner, dependency, or timeline, record it here the same day.

## Open items to resolve (keep short)

- **O-1:** Grade-band structure (A/B/C) decision + rationale (and whether any sub-band guidance is needed)
- **O-2:** Enforcement posture for integrity/attribution (educational vs disciplinary emphasis; escalation path)
- **O-3:** Tool access and governance model (district-provided vs BYO; conditions for classroom access)
- **O-4:** Records retention / consent / privacy boundaries for AI tools (what is “allowed by default” vs “requires review/approval”)
- **O-5:** Recommendation domains + outline structure (what is in/out of committee recommendations)
