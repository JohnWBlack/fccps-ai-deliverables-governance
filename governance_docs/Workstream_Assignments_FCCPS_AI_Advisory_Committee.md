- Identify classroom constraints and PD needs; test guidance for usability and clarity

### Next deliverable
**Scenario Bank v1:** 10–15 grade-banded scenarios across subjects (AI-aware / AI-assisted / AI-resistant) + 3 “exemplar” teacher-facing guidance sheets

### Dependencies
- Access to teacher input (quick pulse: top concerns + top use cases)
- Clarified definitions from baseline (what counts as “AI assistance”)

- Create educator + student guidance for implementing integrity and attribution consistently

### Next deliverable
**Attribution & Integrity Matrix v1:** grade band × assessment type expectations + recommended safeguards (design patterns) + draft “student-facing attribution rules”

### Dependencies
- Classroom Scenario Bank v1 (realistic assessment situations)
- Current FCCPS assessment realities (common formats, constraints, grading practices)
- Agreement on enforcement posture (educational vs. disciplinary emphasis; escalation path)

## Data Privacy & Security

- **Lead:** Jillian Marie Burkley

### Next deliverable
**AI Tool Review Checklist v1 + Risk Tiers:** required questions (data minimization/retention/vendor terms), approval workflow sketch, and draft policy language for privacy/security guardrails

### Dependencies
- FCCPS procurement/tool approval workflow owners + current process artifacts
- Any existing DPAs/vendor templates and records retention requirements
- Clarification on where student/staff data lives and flows (systems inventory at a high level)

---

## Equity & Access

- **Contributors:** Jillian Burkley, Adriana Palacios  

### Responsibilities
- Assess equity impacts (access gaps, accommodations, language, disability) for proposed policy/tools
- Recommend accessibility standards and supports to mitigate unintended harm
- Define equity metrics and feedback loops to monitor disparities after implementation

### Next deliverable
**Equity Impact Checklist v1:** accessibility/accommodations considerations + “do no harm” risks + recommended supports and metrics to monitor equity outcomes

### Dependencies
- SPED/504/ELL and accessibility input (current accommodations practices)
- Device/connectivity/access landscape (even a high-level summary)
- Draft policy direction on student/staff allowed uses (so equity lens can be applied concretely)
