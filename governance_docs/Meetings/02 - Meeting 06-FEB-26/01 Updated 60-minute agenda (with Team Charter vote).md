02 – Meeting 06-FEB-26 Run of Show

# 1) Updated 60-minute agenda (with Team Charter vote)

## 0:00–0:03 — Adopt agenda

-   Motion + vote (quick).
-   **Chair note:** “Today we will leave with three artifacts: Definitions & Assumptions, Priority Misconceptions, Draft Grade Bands.”

## 0:03–0:06 — Approve prior minutes

-   Motion + vote.

## 0:06–0:10 — Public comment (if any)

## 0:10–0:15 — Liaisons’ updates (School Board + staff)

-   Capture constraints that affect grade bands / tool access / comms.

## 0:15–0:27 — Team Alignment artifacts + Team Charter v1 (review)

**Purpose:** show the work you did from the questionnaire; socialize changes; tee up a clean vote.

## 0:15–0:18 (3 min) — “What we learned” lightning summary

-   3–5 bullets from questionnaire synthesis (patterns, not individuals).
-   1 slide or 1 Miro frame: “What this changes in how we work.”

## 0:18–0:22 (4 min) — Walkthrough (high level)

-   Team Alignment Map (30–60 sec)
-   Team Contract (60 sec)
-   Roles & Leads (60 sec)
-   Team Charter v1 changes vs v0.9 (60 sec)

## 0:22–0:27 (5 min) — Team Charter v1 discussion + vote

-   Prompt: “Any must-fix edits for clarity/scope/decision method?”
-   Park “nice-to-haves” unless truly material.
-   Motion: “Approve Team Charter v1 as committee operating charter.”
-   Vote + record.

Where it “fits” in the standing agenda: It’s a **Decision** that enables the focus work. Putting it at the *front* prevents procedural churn later.

## 0:27–0:50 — Focus block (Shared baseline: capabilities/limits + classroom reality)

Goal: produce the three “leave the room with” outputs.

**Structure:** 3 sprints + 1 quick converge.

### Sprint A (0:27–0:34) — Common vocabulary (Definitions + Assumptions sheet)

-   In-room method: small groups each own 1–2 terms, then reconcile.
-   Terms to lock (from your outline):
    -   “AI” (general), “generative,” “reasoning,” “tool vs tutor”
    -   “copilot vs autopilot”
-   Output contribution: definitions + 3–5 assumptions (e.g., “AI output can be wrong/confident,” “models vary,” “district tools differ from consumer tools,” etc.)

### Sprint B (0:34–0:41) — “Myths to kill” → priority misconceptions

-   Prompt: “What are the 8–12 misconceptions that will hurt implementation unless we address them?”
-   Include your starting set:
    -   “glorified search”
    -   “detectors solve integrity”
    -   “AI is always wrong/right”
-   Output contribution: ranked list (top tier vs parking lot)

### Sprint C (0:41–0:47) — 3 classroom scenarios + quick grade-band implications

-   Scenarios (from your outline):
    1.  student use
    2.  teacher use
    3.  assessment integrity (quick triage)
-   For each: “Allowed / constrained / not allowed (default)” + “What changes by grade band?”

### Converge (0:47–0:50) — Grade-banding decision (draft)

-   Decide the **structure** (not every detail):
    -   PK–2 / 3–5 / 6–8 / 9–12 (or whatever FCCPS prefers)
-   Output contribution: “Draft grade bands for policy guidance structure” (one line each)

## 0:50–0:57 — Decisions made + action items + parking lot

-   Confirm **what was decided**:
    -   Team Charter v1 approved
    -   Definitions v0.1 approved (or “published as working draft”)
    -   Misconceptions v0.1 approved (or “working draft”)
    -   Grade bands draft selected
-   Assign owners for between-meeting refinement of each artifact.

## 0:57–1:00 — Confirm next steps / adjourn

-   Preview: between-meeting “Top 3 risks + top 3 opportunities” intake.

# 2) Pre-work + pre-reads (so the focus block actually lands)

## What you post to Miro before the meeting (read-only for members)

Create **one “Meeting 2” landing frame** with links to sub-frames:

### Team Alignment artifacts

### Team Alignment Map

### Team Contract

### Roles & Leads

### Team Charter v1 (with version notes: “what changed from v0.9”)

### Focus Block working frames (pre-built templates)

### **Frame A:** Definitions + Assumptions (table)

### **Frame B:** Misconceptions (vote dots)

### **Frame C:** 3 Scenarios (cards) + Grade band draft (selector)

## What you email 24–48 hours prior (short, direct)

### *“Please skim the Miro Meeting 2 landing frame.”*

### *“Come ready to vote on Team Charter v1.”*

### *“Come with: (a) one misconception you hear in the real world, (b) one classroom scenario that worries you.”*

# 3) Miro-ready content templates (copy/paste)

## A) Definitions + Assumptions sheet (one page)

### Definitions (working)

-   AI:
-   Generative AI:
-   Reasoning system:
-   Tool vs tutor:
-   Copilot vs autopilot:
-   Attribution (in student work):
-   Assessment integrity:

### Assumptions we are designing for (draft)

-   A1: {Assumption}
-   A2: {Assumption}
-   A3: {Assumption}
-   A4: {Assumption}
-   A5: {Assumption}

## B) Priority misconceptions (ranked)

### Tier 1 (must address in comms/PD)

1.  {Misconception}
2.  {Misconception}
3.  {Misconception}
4.  {Misconception}
5.  {Misconception}

### Tier 2 (important)

1.  {Misconception}
2.  {Misconception}
3.  {Misconception}
4.  {Misconception}
5.  {Misconception}

### Parking lot

-   {Misconception}

## C) Scenarios + grade-band structure

### Scenario 1: Student use (learning)

-   Default posture:
-   Allowed examples:
-   Constrained examples:
-   Not allowed examples:
-   What changes by grade band:

Scenario 2: Teacher use (instructional + professional)  
(same prompts)

### Scenario 3: Assessment integrity

-   Biggest risk:
-   Default guardrail candidates:
-   What changes by grade band:

### Grade bands (draft)

-   PK–2:
-   3–5:
-   6–8:
-   9–12:

# 4) Between-meeting intake: “Top 3 risks + top 3 opportunities”

You’re right: introduce it briefly *in the meeting* so it doesn’t feel like surprise homework.

## 30-second script at 0:57

“Between now and Meeting 3, we’re collecting each member’s top 3 risks and top 3 opportunities. We’ll synthesize and bring a combined view into our values/principles session so we’re debating real tradeoffs, not abstractions.”

## Make it safe + fast

-   **1:1 submission to co-chairs** (as you already outlined)
-   Encourage concise format:
    -   Risk: \__\_ \| Why it matters: \__\_ \| Possible mitigation: \__\_
    -   Opportunity: \__\_ \| Value unlocked: \__\_ \| What we’d need: \__\_

## Risk to manage (and mitigation)

-   Risk: low response rate → weak synthesis → Meeting 3 loses traction
-   Mitigation**:** set a firm deadline + make it “small”
    -   Deadline: **Tue 10 Feb, 5pm** (gives you time to synthesize)
    -   Limit: **3 bullets each**, not paragraphs
