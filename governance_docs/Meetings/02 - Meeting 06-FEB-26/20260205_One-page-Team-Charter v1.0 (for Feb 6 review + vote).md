One-page Team Charter v1.0 (for Feb 6 review + in-person vote)
**FCCPS AI in Schools Ad Hoc Advisory Committee - Team Charter (Draft v1.0)**
**Period:** Jan-May 2026 (8 scheduled meetings; additional sessions if approved)  **Authority:** Falls Church City School Board (AI policy development process)
# Mission
Recommend an age-appropriate, human-centered approach to AI that personalizes learning and prepares students for the future while protecting fairness, belonging, safety, and integrity.
# Objectives
A) Human-centered learning: strengthen learning and creativity without replacing effortful learning or student agency.
B) Safety, equity, trust, integrity: clear expectations that protect well-being and academic/professional integrity.
C) Practical guardrails that scale: grade-banded guidance and a governance model that adapts as tools evolve.
D) Implementation readiness: PD recommendations, classroom exemplars, communications guidance, and friction reduction.
# Deliverables (committee outputs)
1) April 2026 Board work session package: 1-page executive summary; policy principles/definitions; grade-banded student and staff guidance; assessment integrity and attribution expectations; governance/access model + review cadence; implementation recommendations (PD, examples, comms, evaluation).
2) Community engagement support: attend town halls as listeners when feasible; encourage participation.
3) May 2026 response package: review proposed policy language; must-fix / should-fix / nice-to-have recommendations.
# Scope
IN: teaching/learning guidance; student/staff use norms; assessment integrity; privacy/data; tool governance/access; equity/accessibility; comms and implementation supports.
OUT: individual discipline cases; personnel actions; vendor award decisions; legal determinations; work not tied to the AI policy effort.

# How we work
- Meetings: noticed in-person meetings are the forum for deliberation and votes.
- Between meetings: independent work (research, drafting, data calls). Submit inputs via webform or direct message to chair/workstream leads; avoid reply-all deliberation.
- Draft-first: circulate early text, options, and examples; meetings resolve decisions.
- Feedback: direct, specific, constructive; propose alternative wording when critiquing.
- Records: agendas, minutes, decision log, and action tracker maintained; avoid student PII; assume public records requirements apply.
# Decision method
- Default: consent ("good enough to try") unless a reasoned objection ties to mission, safety/well-being, equity/access, legality/compliance, integrity, or feasibility.
- High-stakes (safety, equity, privacy/security, integrity baseline): strive for consensus.
- If blocked and time-sensitive: vote in a noticed meeting - substantive recommendations target supermajority (about 7/10); procedural decisions use majority of members present.
# Team norms
IN: assume positive intent; challenge ideas, not people; share airtime; timebox disagreements; keep decisions visible; assign owners and due dates.
OUT: sarcasm, side conversations, posturing; endless rehashing; scope creep; reply-all debate between meetings; "gotcha" critique without alternatives.
# Roles
- Chair (John Black): facilitation and decision flow; synthesis and drafting; agenda design; decision log and action tracker; publish pre-reads and artifacts.
- Project manager/operations (Adriana Palacios): coordination; timeline/dependencies; capture stakeholder voice into communications and implementation planning.
- School Board liaisons / FCCPS support (Jerrod Anderson, Bethany Henderson) and staff liaisons: charge clarification, constraints, district context, process guidance.
- Workstream leads/co-leads: own outputs; coordinate contributors; deliver drafts on schedule.
- Members: contribute to assigned workstreams; complete between-meeting tasks; provide timely input.
# Collaboration tools
Miro board (shared artifacts); email (broadcast-only for notices/materials); webform or direct message (primary channel for inputs/edits).
