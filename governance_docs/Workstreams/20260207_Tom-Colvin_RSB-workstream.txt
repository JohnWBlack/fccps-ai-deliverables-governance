SUBJECT: Research & Shared Baseline (WS-RSB): guidance and deliverable for 20 Feb
Hi Tom,
Thank you again for leading Research & Shared Baseline, with Elizabeth as co-lead.
Your next deliverable: Shared Baseline Brief v1 (2–3 pages) for committee review at Meeting 3 (Fri 20 Feb)
Definition of done:
•	AI capabilities/limits (plain language; practical implications for schools)
•	Misconceptions to “kill” (prioritized, with brief corrective framing)
•	Key terms / definitions (working definitions suitable for policy drafting)
•	“Classroom reality” examples (student use, teacher use, integrity triage)
•	Annotated resource list (top ~10)
Where the input is
•	Focus Block sticky-note extractions and dot-votes are posted on the Miro Shared Baseline frame.
•	You’re also encouraged to draw from the Team Formation materials, Resources area, and your own research.
How we’ll use this on 20 Feb
•	The Shared Baseline will feed the committee’s Values & Principles convergence (policy principles + tradeoff statement).
•	We are aiming for enough convergence by Meeting 4 (6 Mar) that all workstreams can draft in alignment.
Coordination
I’m not emailing you and Elizabeth together to avoid creating a committee “meeting” by email, but please coordinate with Elizabeth directly on division of labor and synthesis.  Her email address (in case you don't have) is efchua@gmail.com. 
If helpful, here’s a suggested structure:
1.	Capabilities/limits (what’s reliable vs brittle)
2.	Misconceptions (ranked, with correction)
3.	Working definitions (short)
4.	Classroom reality: 3–5 concrete vignettes
5.	Implications (what this means for policy design)
6.	Annotated resources (top 10)

Diverge–converge work can feel uncomfortable because the “messy middle” is where real differences surface. Divergence creates a wide option space—useful, but cognitively noisy—while convergence requires tradeoffs, constraints, and choices that inevitably leave good ideas on the table. That emotional friction is normal: it’s the sensation of moving from “everything could be true” to “we’re choosing what will guide decisions.”
A clean way to keep the discomfort productive is to make the convergence criteria explicit and timeboxed. Name what you’re optimizing for (student learning, staff feasibility, equity, safety, legal compliance), apply a simple quality filter (“decision-guiding, testable, not implementation

Thanks again,
John
