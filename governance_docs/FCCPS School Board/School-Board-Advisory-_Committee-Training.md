**It is time for the meeting to begin, most people are there.**

Do this:

Determine if you have a simple majority of voting members to hold the meeting. If you don’t you can hold the meeting but no business can be conducted.

Not that:

Hold the meeting without counting, everyone usually shows up.

*You must have a quorum.*

**You receive an email from a parent sent to all members of the advisory.**

Do this…

You respond thanking them for reaching out copying your Staff Liaison and board member–only.

Not that:

You reply all and set up a meeting with parent with another committee member to hear their concerns.

*Don’t reply all and don’t get in situations that can be considered a meeting.*

**Two parents attend the meeting and share a concern about a teacher’s class and their student during public comments.**

Do this…

Let them speak if they followed the process for public comment. Let the Division Staff Liaison address the matter.

Not that:

Ask if any other members have had the same experience and discuss.

*Don’t get involved in staff and/or student issues.*

**A member posts the minutes from a meeting on social media.**

Do this…

Remind them that their action doesn’t follow Policy 5.12 and ask them to take the minutes down until the Advisory has had a chance to review, revise if needed, and vote to approve the minutes.

Not that:

Ignore it.

*Advisory approved minutes are posted on the webpage by the division.*
