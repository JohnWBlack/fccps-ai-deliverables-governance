# Purpose and scope

Generative AI tools can produce human-like text and multimedia and are becoming widely accessible. APS frames this guidance as a **living document** meant to help leaders, staff, families, and students align GenAI use with district values and strategic objectives. ([Arlington Public Schools](https://www.apsva.us/digital-learning-innovation/aps-generative-ai-guidance/))

**Related APS initiative:** “Year of AI Empowered Learning (2025–26)” — <https://www.apsva.us/digital-learning-innovation/year-of-generative-ai/> ([Arlington Public Schools](https://www.apsva.us/departments/academics/aps-generative-ai-guidance/year-of-generative-ai/))

# Defining generative AI

**Artificial intelligence** refers to systems that use algorithms, data, and compute to perform tasks associated with human intelligence (e.g., learning, reasoning, language). **Generative AI** is a subset that creates new content (text, images, audio, code, video) by learning patterns from existing data and inputs. ([Arlington Public Schools](https://www.apsva.us/digital-learning-innovation/aps-generative-ai-guidance/))

# Interacting with generative AI

**AI literacy** is presented as the skills needed to use AI effectively and responsibly—understanding limitations, monitoring output quality, and thinking critically about impacts. APS emphasizes that AI literacy supports educators’ instructional practice and prepares K–12 students for broader real-world use. ([Arlington Public Schools](https://www.apsva.us/digital-learning-innovation/aps-generative-ai-guidance/))

# Guiding the adoption of GenAI in APS

APS highlights potential benefits (instructional support, differentiation, creativity, reduced administrative workload) while also naming core risks APS intends to manage: mistakes and bias in outputs, misuse of sensitive information, plagiarism/misrepresentation, harms to wellbeing, integrity concerns, and IP/copyright issues. ([Arlington Public Schools](https://www.apsva.us/digital-learning-innovation/aps-generative-ai-guidance/))

APS describes the framework as **aspirational** (a target state for safe, ethical, responsible use) and a tool to align existing practices while shaping future work. ([Arlington Public Schools](https://www.apsva.us/digital-learning-innovation/aps-generative-ai-guidance/))

# Guiding principles (high level)

## Teaching & Learning

APS intends to use GenAI to strengthen teaching and learning. ([Arlington Public Schools](https://www.apsva.us/digital-learning-innovation/aps-generative-ai-guidance/))

## Professionalism & Operational Efficiency

APS frames staff use as informed, responsible, and oriented toward continuous improvement. ([Arlington Public Schools](https://www.apsva.us/digital-learning-innovation/aps-generative-ai-guidance/))

## Personal & Social Wellbeing

APS positions GenAI use to support the community and reduce harms, with attention to wellbeing. ([Arlington Public Schools](https://www.apsva.us/digital-learning-innovation/aps-generative-ai-guidance/))

## Transparency

APS aims for the community to understand when/how GenAI is used and what impacts follow. ([Arlington Public Schools](https://www.apsva.us/digital-learning-innovation/aps-generative-ai-guidance/))

## Equity

APS frames GenAI deployment around accessibility, inclusivity, and respectful use across the community. ([Arlington Public Schools](https://www.apsva.us/digital-learning-innovation/aps-generative-ai-guidance/))

## Accountability

APS emphasizes human governance and clear responsibility for AI-supported decisions. ([Arlington Public Schools](https://www.apsva.us/digital-learning-innovation/aps-generative-ai-guidance/))

## Privacy, Security & Safety

APS states that recommended tools must protect privacy and personal data for staff and students. ([Arlington Public Schools](https://www.apsva.us/digital-learning-innovation/aps-generative-ai-guidance/))

# Framework development, use, and review

## How the framework was developed

APS says it adapted multiple sources, explicitly including Australia’s national framework on GenAI in schools, and conducted internal consultation across APS stakeholder groups under a cross-department steering committee. ([Arlington Public Schools](https://www.apsva.us/digital-learning-innovation/aps-generative-ai-guidance/))

## How APS intends the guidance to be used

APS presents this as **non-binding guidance**—a reference for reflection and action—meant to support policy/practice/resource development while allowing variation across schools and classrooms. APS also notes it is **not** a product recommendation list or step-by-step adoption plan. ([Arlington Public Schools](https://www.apsva.us/digital-learning-innovation/aps-generative-ai-guidance/))

## How the guidance will be reviewed

APS plans periodic updates driven by feedback/data collection (e.g., surveys, interviews, case studies) and engagement with internal and external stakeholders, led by the steering committee with advisory input. ([Arlington Public Schools](https://www.apsva.us/digital-learning-innovation/aps-generative-ai-guidance/))

# Detailed guiding principles (paraphrased)

## Teaching & Learning

APS lists practical expectations such as:

1.  Use GenAI where it improves instruction and/or reduces administrative friction while supporting learning outcomes. ([Arlington Public Schools](https://www.apsva.us/digital-learning-innovation/aps-generative-ai-guidance/))
2.  Teach students how GenAI works, including limits and bias, with deeper engagement as readiness grows. ([Arlington Public Schools](https://www.apsva.us/digital-learning-innovation/aps-generative-ai-guidance/))
3.  Treat teachers as the primary instructional experts; GenAI should support—not replace—professional judgment. ([Arlington Public Schools](https://www.apsva.us/digital-learning-innovation/aps-generative-ai-guidance/))
4.  Use GenAI to expand critical and creative thinking rather than narrowing it. ([Arlington Public Schools](https://www.apsva.us/digital-learning-innovation/aps-generative-ai-guidance/))
5.  Make assignment/assessment rules explicit about whether/how GenAI may be used. ([Arlington Public Schools](https://www.apsva.us/digital-learning-innovation/aps-generative-ai-guidance/))
6.  Teach ethical use, including appropriate credit/citation expectations. ([Arlington Public Schools](https://www.apsva.us/digital-learning-innovation/aps-generative-ai-guidance/))
7.  Special education notes include: do **not** input student PII; GenAI may help brainstorm IEP language but must be edited and individualized; do not let chatbots “stand in” for parents in meetings; do not record/transcribe/summarize IEP meetings unless an approved tool is verified for privacy/security (APS notes no currently approved tool for that purpose). ([Arlington Public Schools](https://www.apsva.us/digital-learning-innovation/aps-generative-ai-guidance/))
