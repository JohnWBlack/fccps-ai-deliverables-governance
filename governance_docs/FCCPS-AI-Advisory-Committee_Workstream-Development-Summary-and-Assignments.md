Workstream Development Summary & Lead Assignments

**Version:** v1.0  
**Last updated:** 2026-02-18  
**Purpose:** Summarize workstream development outputs and memorialize the assignment of workstream **leads** and **co-leads** (system-of-record snapshot for committee operations).

***

# 1. Overview

On **6 Feb 2026 (Meeting 2)**, the committee established eight workstreams to accelerate parallel development of research, policy drafting, and implementation recommendations. Workstreams are designed to converge through committee decision gates into a board-ready recommendations package.

This document captures:

-   Workstream structure (IDs, names)
-   Assigned leads/co-leads and known contributors
-   Core responsibilities and first deliverables (“v1” outputs)
-   Cross-workstream dependencies (high-level)

>   **System of record note:** The canonical, machine-readable registry and timeline remain the Workstreams Registry and Master Timeline files referenced below.

# 4. Workstream responsibilities (high-level)

## WS-RSB — Research & Shared Baseline

-   Curate shared baseline on AI capabilities/limits, misconceptions, key terms, and classroom-reality examples
-   Maintain annotated resource library + peer-district scan
-   Produce concise briefs that reduce uncertainty and support decision-making

## WS-POL — Policy/Recommendation Drafting

-   Own master outline and integrate inputs from all workstreams into coherent draft text
-   Draft language options + decision points; maintain version history and decision log
-   Package board-ready deliverables (written recommendations, appendices, executive summary)

## WS-CPX — Classroom Practice & Examples

-   Collect and validate grade-banded classroom scenarios and use cases
-   Translate policy into teacher-facing guidance, exemplars, prompts, and rubrics
-   Identify usability constraints and PD needs; test guidance for clarity

## WS-AIN — Assessment & Integrity

-   Define attribution expectations and acceptable AI assistance by grade and assessment type
-   Recommend integrity safeguards (assessment design patterns, process evidence)
-   Produce educator + student guidance for consistent implementation

## WS-DPS — Data Privacy & Security

-   Define privacy/security requirements (minimization, retention, consent, records compliance)
-   Create AI tool review checklist and risk-tiering aligned to governance/procurement
-   Recommend vendor management expectations, guardrails, and incident considerations

## WS-EQA — Equity & Access

-   Assess equity impacts (access gaps, accommodations, disability, language)
-   Recommend accessibility standards and supports to mitigate unintended harm
-   Define metrics and feedback loops to monitor disparities after implementation

## WS-CCI — Communications & Community Input

-   Develop communications plan and key messages for families, students, staff
-   Plan and synthesize community input (listening sessions, surveys, FAQs)
-   Draft public-facing FAQs and guidance to build clarity and trust

## WS-IPC — Implementation/PD & Change Adoption

-   Build implementation roadmap (phasing, pilots, milestones, owners, sequencing)
-   Define success metrics, feedback loops, and review cadence
-   Create adoption toolkits/templates (PD modules, checklists, exemplars)

***

# 5. Cross-workstream dependencies (what must align)

A small set of early alignments will prevent downstream rework:

-   **Definitions/assumptions and grade bands** (WS-RSB + chair integration) must be stable enough to guide WS-CPX and WS-AIN outputs.
-   **Tool governance and privacy/security guardrails** (WS-DPS) must inform recommendations structure (WS-POL) and operationalization (WS-IPC).
-   **Equity lens** (WS-EQA) should be applied early to avoid retrofitting accessibility and access supports into late-stage drafts.
-   **Comms strategy** (WS-CCI) should track evolving policy posture and be ready to accompany the near-final package.

***

# 6. Governance artifacts and where to find “source of truth”

Use the following project files as the authoritative references for process, schedule, and deliverables:

1.  **Workstream assignments (Miro-captured) — narrative source**
    -   FCCPS AI Advisory Committee — Workstream assignments
2.  **Workstreams Registry (System of Record) — canonical assignments + responsibilities + v1 deliverables**
    -   FCCPS AI Advisory Committee — Workstreams Registry (System of Record)
3.  **Policy Recommendations Process and Timeline — committee process and milestones**
    -   FCCPS AI Advisory Committee — Policy Recommendations Process and Timeline
4.  **Master Timeline (Workstream-aligned) — integrated schedule with decision gates and deliverables**
    -   FCCPS AI Advisory Committee — Master Timeline (Workstream-aligned)
5.  **Deliverables Index — one-line tracker of deliverables, owners, due checkpoints**
    -   FCCPS AI Advisory Committee — Deliverables Index (v1.1 preferred)
6.  **Decision & Change Log — prevent drift; record decisions and changes affecting downstream work**
    -   FCCPS AI Advisory Committee — Decision & Change Log

***

# 7. Next actions (recommended)

-   Confirm **WS-AIN co-lead** assignment (or decide to keep unassigned with explicit support plan).
-   Keep the **Workstreams Registry** and **Master Timeline** updated weekly (status, blockers, dependencies).
-   Require that any change to scope, owners, deadlines, grade bands, or enforcement posture is recorded in the **Decision & Change Log** the same day.
