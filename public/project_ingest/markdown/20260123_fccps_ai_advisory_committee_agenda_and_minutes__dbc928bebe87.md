| Item: | Notes: |
| Adoption of the Agenda | Agenda reviewed. No objections noted; agenda adopted by consent. |
| Welcome & Introductions | Board liaisons welcomed members and confirmed the committee’s advisory role. Co-chairs introduced a structured facilitation approach focused on usable drafts. Members introduced themselves and shared perspectives on opportunities/risks of AI in K-12. |
| Adoption of the Minutes from the Previous Meeting | N/A – inaugural meeting. |
| Public Comments | No public comments were offered. |
| Review of the School Board Charge | Charge framed as synthesizing best practices, learning from other districts, and incorporating general public input. Parallel input streams noted:

staff/teacher working group, student input process, standing committees, and upcoming public town halls. Committee deliverable: recommendations (and suggested policy language elements) for the April School Board meeting dedicated to AI. |
| School Board Liaison Report | Open-meeting expectations emphasized (Virginia FOIA / Sunshine Law): avoid multi-member email threads and real-time back-and-forth outside noticed meetings. Broadcast communications allowed (e.g., agenda distribution) but reply-all discouraged. Additional meetings or extensions may be scheduled in advance if needed. |
| Division Staff Liaison Report | Staff working group shared current work (Compass framing and AI readiness/integrity considerations). Teacher and student feedback mechanisms described (surveys/focus groups) to inform professional development and guidance. Need reinforced for practical tools and training to support staff implementation. |
| Topic/Action Item | Meeting minutes and records: required elements of minutes reviewed (date/time/location, members present, summary of matters proposed/deliberated/decided, and any votes). AI transcription (Otter AI) discussed: permitted, but minutes must remain co

ncise and accurate; committee reviews/approves minutes at the next meeting. Records-retention implications noted: AI transcripts/recordings can increase FOIA/FERPA burden; balance transparency with administrative feasibility. |
| Topic/Action Item | Collaboration tools: Miro board introduced for organizing resources and displaying work products. Constraint confirmed: members should not co-edit a shared board asynchronously; view-only access recommended; contributions routed 1:1 to co-chairs (or via web form). Email etiquette discussed: avoid reply-all; maintain a clear contact list; use a web form to intake resources/ideas safely. |
| Discussion of Future Action Items | Co-chairs to solicit purpose/vision inputs and compile for synthesis. Members to complete “My User Manual” and an assessment of dominant logic/Competing Values (as shared by co-chairs). Members encouraged to attend district AI town halls as listeners and to recruit community participation. Target: recommendations prepared for April School Board AI meeting. |
| Adjournment | Meeting concluded at approximately 9:36 AM. No votes were taken. |
