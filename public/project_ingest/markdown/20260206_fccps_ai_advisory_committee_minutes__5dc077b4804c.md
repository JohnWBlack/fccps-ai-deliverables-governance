Date of Meeting: Friday, February 6, 2026

Location of Meeting: FCCPS School Board Office (Multi-Purpose Room)

Time of Meeting: 8:30–~9:50 AM (in-person).

# Action Items (captured from discussion)

John Black: Post meeting materials (including sticky-note board photos) to the committee Miro board and send a post-meeting email summarizing assignments, deadlines, and next-meeting inputs.

| --- | --- |
| Item: | Notes: |
| Adoption of the Agenda | Chair reviewed the standing agenda model and conducted a voice vote. No objections noted; agenda adopted. |
| Approval of Prior Minutes | The January 23, 2026 minutes were approved by a unanimous vote. |
| Public Comments | Visitors introduced themselves; no formal public comments were offered beyond introductions and questions. |
| School Board / Staff Liaison Updates | Liaisons reiterated parallel input streams (staff/teacher/admin work, student input, public town halls) that will converge for the April School Board checkpoint. Scope guidance: this committee should focus on broad, general policy guidance (not vendor selection, detailed implementation planning, or prescriptive professional-development hour requirements). Lia

isons noted that the committee may recommend a cadence for revisiting the AI policy (review cycle). |
| Team Formation and Workstream Structure | Chair summarized patterns from members’ questionnaire responses (aggregated, not individual) and reviewed decision-making and collaboration constraints for a public advisory committee (avoid multi-member back-and-forth outside noticed meetings; use 1:1 lead/co-lead pairs; route synthesis back to Chair for sharing in meetings).  Chair proposed initial workstreams and nominated leads/co-leads (working assignments; subject to refinement): • Research & shared baseline: Tom Sabo and Elizabeth Chua • Policy/recommendation drafting: David Berol (with Chair support) • Classroom Practice & Examples: Anubav Vasudevan and Susan Nelson • Assessment & Integrity: David Berol (with Chair support) • Data/privacy/security: Jillian Burkley (with Chair support) • Communications/community input: Tina Beaty and Adriana Palacios • Implementation/change adoption: Jillian Burkley and Adriana Palacios Bonarrigo • Equity/access; Tom Sabo and Elizabeth Chua. |
| Team Charter v1 (review and edits) | Chair presented a revised Team Charter (v1 draft) synthesized from

prior meeting discussion and questionnaire inputs, including team values (e.g., integrity/transparency; psychological safety & respectful challenge; equity & inclusion; evidence/practicality; accountability; iteration/adaptability).  Draft mission statement discussed: “Recommend an age-appropriate, human-centered approach to AI that personalizes learning and prepares students for the future while protecting fairness, belonging, safety, and integrity.” A motion was raised to revise “personalizes learning” to “enhances learning.” Members also discussed scope language (e.g., “students” vs broader “FCCPS community” language) to reflect policy impacts on educators/staff/families while remaining within the committee’s remit.  An additional proviso was added to note that the team charter is a working document, subject to revision. The committee adopted Team Charter v1 unanimously. |
| Focus Block: Shared Baseline (Sprint A/B/C + Converge) | The committee completed a rapid, sticky-note-based focus block to surface assumptions, misconceptions to address, classroom scenario guidance, and a draft grade-band structure for organizing guidance.  Highlights (see Appendix A for full capture): • To

p assumption by dot-vote: “Students & staff will have AI access regardless of school policy.” • Top misconception by dot-vote: “AI replaces teachers.” • Scenario guardrails emphasized: constrain AI-written full student responses without personal contribution; prohibit autonomous grading/feedback without educator review; identify where AI support may be beneficial (e.g., lesson ideation; writing revision support). • Grade-band converge dot-vote favored Option C (Elementary/Middle/High) as a workable starting structure. |
| Next Steps and Adjournment | Next meeting focus: members will provide “Top 3 risks” and “Top 3 opportunities” for AI in FCCPS; workstream synthesis will be presented for discussion and vote, where appropriate. Motion to adjourn was made; meeting adjourned by voice vote. |
