Meeting 3 (20 FEB) Focus Block

Below is a complete, revised 25-minute run-of-show for Meeting 3’s Values & Principles Focus Block, incorporating everything we built in this thread:

F1 six synthesized themes (read-only)

F2 printed + onscreen 12 AI Seed Drafts

Camera as capture device

AI as formatter / reviewer / suggester (not the decider)

F3 “AI pre-score → human confirm/override”

F4 Merge + Cap to 8–12

F5 camera+AI tradeoff analysis

F6 consent-first ratification with “one cannot consent” handling

# Focus Block Outputs

By minute 25, you will have:

8–12 merged principles in F4 (numbered and sponsor-initialed)

1 finalized tradeoff statement in F5 (plus one backup recorded)

Consent record in F6 (and any exception/smallest-change requests captured)

Cut list recorded (not lost)

## Roles and Responsibilities

Assign these before the focus block begins:

### Facilitator (you)

Keeps pace, frames decisions, prevents debate spirals

Chooses collision pair when needed to maintain timebox

Runs consent check and captures smallest-change requests

### AI Operator (camera + model)

Takes photos at marked moments

Runs prompts and posts output into “AI Suggestions (not decisions)” area

Never moves cards; never “decides” placements

### Wall Marshal (physical)

Keeps wall orderly

Ensures sponsor initials on Pass items

Ensures FR tags and “Revise to…” notes are attached where needed

### Miro Scribe (digital mirror)

Mirrors wall moves to Miro (can lag slightly—capture photos as backup)

Creates merged stickies in F4 as directed by merge leads

### Timekeeper

Calls “30 seconds” and “time” for each step

## Materials Checklist (Physical + Digital)

### Physical wall

F1 themes poster (read-only)

F2 grid with 12 printed AI Seed Drafts (P1–P12)

Blank stickies + thick markers

Pass / Revise / Park zones clearly labeled

FR tags list visible (FR1–FR6)

Sponsor rule reminder: “No Pass without initials”

### Miro board

F1 themes filled

F2 AI seed cards visible (same layout as printed)

Pass / Revise / Park lanes

F4 Merge + Cap slots (1–12)

F5 Tradeoff Statement Builder

F6 Ratification area

A side panel labeled: AI Suggestions (not decisions)

## Ground Rules You Say Once (and enforce quietly)

Humans move the cards.

Every kept principle has a human sponsor (initials).

AI can suggest and score; AI cannot decide.

20-second rule: if it’s not resolvable in 20 seconds → Revise.

No wordsmithing in F3/F4: minimal edits only.

# The 25-Minute Run-of-Show (Minute-by-minute)

## 0:00–0:04 — Launch + F1 orientation + “what a principle is”

### Stage directions

Project the F1–F6 strip in one view.

Point to the physical wall and then to Miro.

### Facilitator script

“We have 25 minutes to produce a draft set of 8–12 principles plus one tradeoff statement.
We’ll use AI to accelerate—camera captures, AI formats/reviews/suggests—but the committee decides.
Every principle that survives has a human sponsor.”

### F1 check (no new themes)

“These six themes are read-only. Any missing theme that would change our principles?
If it’s nice-to-have but doesn’t change principles, we keep moving.”

### Define “principle”

“Principles are decision language, not implementation steps.
Use: ‘FCCPS will…’ or ‘When X conflicts with Y, we default to… unless…’”

## 0:04–0:07 — F2 Drafting: “Adopt two, write one” (physical-first)

### Stage directions

Send members to the wall. Wall Marshal distributes markers.

Members interact with printed AI seeds and add new stickies.

### Facilitator script

“Everyone to the wall.
Step 1: Adopt two AI seeds you think are important—initial them as sponsor.
Step 2: Write one new principle or a revision on a sticky and place it under the appropriate theme.”

### Wall Marshal reminders (as people work)

“Initial your adopted seeds.”

“One sticky = one principle. Keep it one sentence.”

### AI Operator action (at ~0:06:30)

Take a clean photo of the F2 wall (all candidates visible).

## 0:07–0:13 — F3 Quality Filter (6 minutes)

AI pre-score → Human confirm/override

## 0:07–0:08 — AI pre-score runs while you frame the rule

### AI Operator

Runs the F3 pre-score prompt (below) and posts output in AI Suggestions.

### Facilitator script (exact lines)

“We’re using AI as a checklist robot. It will suggest Pass/Revise/Park so we can move faster—we still decide.
Rule: AI suggests; humans move.
If you disagree, you may override—write ‘OVERRIDE’ on the card or circle it on the AI list.
Use the 20-second rule: if you can’t fix it fast, it goes to Revise.”

0:08–0:11 — Sponsors confirm/override and physically move cards

### Stage directions

Two waves to reduce congestion:

Wave A: Learning + Assessment + Teacher

Wave B: Governance + Equity + Safe Tooling

### What members do

For each card they sponsored:

Confirm AI label → move to Pass / Revise / Park

Override → move where they believe it belongs; mark “OVERRIDE”

If Revise → attach a mini note: “Revise to…” + FR tag if applicable

### FR tags (reference)

FR1 too vague

FR2 implementation detail

FR3 not testable

FR4 conflicts with principle

FR5 actor unclear

FR6 needs tradeoff decision

## 0:11–0:12 — Optional “second read” on Revise pile (only if needed)

### AI Operator

Photo the Revise pile and request minimal edits only.

### Facilitator script

“AI will propose smallest edits for Revise items. Sponsors choose whether to adopt.”

## 0:12–0:13 — Exception sweep + lock triage

### Facilitator script

“Any strong objections to a placement? Call the card and the move in one sentence.
If disagreement persists, it stays in Revise. F3 is now locked.”

### Miro Scribe

Mirrors final Pass/Revise/Park positioning (exact text can lag; photos are the backup).

## 0:13–0:19 — F4 Merge + Cap (6 minutes):

cluster, merge, cap to 8–12, record cut list

## 0:13–0:13:30 — Frame: reduce, don’t perfect

### Facilitator script

“F4 is de-duplication and capping. We are not wordsmithing.
We will cluster near-duplicates, choose the strongest one sentence, and fill 8–12 slots.”

## 0:13:30–0:15 — Human clustering sprint

### Stage directions

Assign two merge leads on the spot (e.g., one instructional/assessment, one governance/privacy).

Everyone else helps cluster.

### What they do

Cluster Pass items by intent (not theme label): learning, integrity, teacher practice, governance, equity, privacy/trust.

Pick a base card per cluster; stack near-duplicates behind it.

### Facilitator script

“Pick a base card for each cluster. Stack duplicates behind it. Don’t rewrite yet—just cluster.”

## 0:15–0:16 — Capture for AI merge suggestions

### AI Operator

Photo the clustered Pass set.

Run merge prompt (below) and post suggested merged wordings + cut list candidates.

## 0:16–0:18 — Merge leads choose strongest wording;

scribe fills slots 1–12

### Stage directions

Miro Scribe creates the merged stickies and places them into F4 slots.

### Facilitator script

“Merge leads: choose the best wording per cluster. Keep it one sentence.
Everything not selected goes to the cut list—recorded, not lost.”

## 0:18–0:19 — Coverage check + collision scan

### Facilitator script

“Do we cover the big areas: learning, integrity, teacher practice, governance, equity, privacy/trust?
Now: where do these collide? Call collisions in two words—privacy vs learning, equity vs consistency, etc.”

You pick one collision for F5 (to protect time).

## 0:19–0:23 — F5 Tradeoff Statement Builder (4 minutes):

Camera+AI tradeoff analysis + human selection/edit

## 0:19–0:19:20 — Frame tradeoff as default posture

### Facilitator script

“Tradeoff = what we prioritize when good principles collide.
Not splitting the difference—choosing a default and naming exceptions.”

## 0:19:20–0:19:50 — Choose collision pair (human)

### Facilitator script

“Collision we will address today: [X vs Y].”

(Example collision used in our simulation: Equity/Accessibility vs Consistency/Comparability.)

## 0:19:50–0:20:20 — Capture inputs (camera)

### AI Operator

Photo/screenshot the merged F4 list + a sticky that states the collision pair.

## 0:20:20–0:21:20 — AI generates 3 options (posted in F5)

### AI Operator

Posts 3 tradeoff statement options as separate stickies in F5 (A/B/C).

## 0:21:20–0:22:40 — Human vote + minimal edit

### Facilitator script

“Quick vote: A, B, or C.”
“Now: smallest edit that makes it something you can support publicly—one sentence.”

### Sponsor rule

“Who will sponsor this tradeoff statement? Initial it.”

## 0:22:40–0:23:00 — Lock + record backup

Facilitator script

“We lock the chosen statement and record the runner-up as backup. Moving to F6.”

## 0:23–0:25 — F6 Ratification (2 minutes):

Consent-first + smallest-change request handling

## 0:23–0:23:30 — Set the consent rule

### Facilitator script

“Consent means you can live with it and support it publicly.
If you cannot consent, you must propose the smallest change that gets you to consent.”

## 0:23:30–0:24:00 — Package consent check

### Facilitator script

“Thumbs up if you consent to the package: the merged principles plus the tradeoff statement.
Hand up if you cannot consent.”

## 0:24:00–0:24:40 — Handle one “cannot consent” without derailing

### Facilitator script

“Thank you. What’s the smallest change that would move you to consent? One sentence.”

### Decision rule

If fixable in 30 seconds → apply edit now

If not fixable → record exception in F6 and proceed

### Facilitator containment line

“We’re not reopening the full list—only deciding whether we can adopt this smallest change right now.”

## 0:24:40–0:25:00 — Lock and capture

### Stage directions

AI Operator takes one final photo of the ratified set (for minutes).

Miro Scribe adds: “Ratified by consent (date)” + exceptions/resolutions.

### Facilitator close

“Consent recorded. Exceptions captured. Focus Block complete.”

# The 12 AI Seed Drafts (P1–P12) for F2 (as printed cards)

Use these as your default seed set:

P1 Deep skills first — FCCPS will design learning that requires student reasoning and reflection, even when AI assistance is available.

P2 AI as coach — FCCPS will encourage AI use that supports learning processes, not replacement of student work products.

P3 Process evidence — FCCPS will use assessment designs that make student thinking visible for high-stakes work.

P4 No detector-only decisions — FCCPS will not base integrity determinations solely on AI detection tools or probability scores.

P5 Teacher judgment leads — FCCPS will treat AI as a support tool; educators remain accountable decision-makers for instruction and evaluation.

P6 Support before expectation — FCCPS will not expect staff adoption without aligned training, exemplars, and accessible guidance.

P7 Tiered permissioning — FCCPS will define AI uses permitted by default, uses requiring review, and uses prohibited due to risk.

P8 Evidence-driven updates — FCCPS will revise AI guidance on a defined cadence using evidence of impact and incidents—not anecdotes.

P9 Equity by design — FCCPS will ensure access to approved AI tools and supports does not depend on home resources.

P10 Human review for high-stakes — FCCPS will require human oversight for AI-influenced decisions affecting grades, supports, or accommodations.

P11 Data minimization — FCCPS will minimize student data shared with AI systems and use only tools with appropriate protections.

P12 Plain-language transparency — FCCPS will communicate approved uses, expectations, and data practices to students and families clearly.

# AI Operator Cheat Sheet (Photos + Prompts)

## Photo moments (minimum)

End of F2: full candidate wall (seeds + write-ins)

Mid F3 (optional): Revise pile only

Mid F4: clustered Pass set

Start F5: merged F4 list + chosen collision pair

End F6: final ratified set

### Prompt 1: Extract + Pre-score (F3 pre-score)

Extract each principle candidate from the photo.
Apply Quality Filter C1–C5. Output one line per card: ID/title — Suggested PASS/REVISE/PARK — FR tags — Minimal edit (if REVISE).
Keep edits one sentence and not implementation-specific.

### Prompt 2: Minimal edits for Revise pile (optional)

For each REVISE item, propose the smallest one-sentence edit to meet C1–C5. Include FR codes addressed.

### Prompt 3: Merge + Cap (F4)

Cluster by shared intent and identify near-duplicates.
Propose one merged “best wording” principle per cluster (one sentence).
Output: merged set of 8–12, cut list with sources, and likely collision pairs.

### Prompt 4: Tradeoff statements (F5)

Using the merged principles and collision pair [X vs Y], draft 3 tradeoff statements (<30 words) using:
(1) prioritize A even when it costs B because C
(2) default X unless exception
(3) accept risk to achieve benefit, mitigated by guardrail
Keep it decision-guiding, not implementation-specific.

# Contingencies (so you never stall)

If AI output is late: proceed human-first using the printed checklist; AI becomes the “second read” for Revise and Merge.

If camera/photo is unreadable: Miro Scribe types rough text for Pass/Revise items; AI operator runs prompts from typed list.

If debate erupts: “20-second rule → Revise” and move on.

If you want, I can also format this into a one-page facilitator script and a one-page operator script (printable), so each role can run their part without scanning a long document.
