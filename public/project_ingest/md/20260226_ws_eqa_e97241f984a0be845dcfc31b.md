Lunch Working Session Agenda — 
Tom Sabo (WS-EQA Equity & Access) + John Black

Purpose: Get WS-EQA moving fast toward a reviewable v1 deliverable for Meeting 4 and a crisp 3–5 minute briefing.

Context anchors (SoR): WS-EQA lead/co-lead assignments and responsibilities; WS-EQA deliverable D-EQA-1 Equity Impact Checklist v1 due 6 Mar (Meeting 4) ; Meeting 4 focus is constraints + risk register and requires D-EQA-1 as an input ; shared baseline realities (access inevitable; detection weak; risks real) .

# 1) Open and align on “what success looks like” (5 min)

Objective: Tom leaves lunch with a simple definition of done and a plan he believes he can execute.

Talking points

Meeting 4 is a convergence gate: we need usable drafts more than perfect prose .

WS-EQA output is explicitly: “Equity Impact Checklist v1: accessibility/accommodations + do-no-harm risks + recommended supports + metrics” .

Reinforce partnership: Tom (lead) + Elizabeth Chua (co-lead) are the intended “1:1 synthesis pair.”

Decision: Confirm we’re targeting a reviewable v1 (not polished/final).

# 2) Clarify the exact written product due for Meeting 4 (10 min)

Objective: Convert “Equity Impact Checklist v1” into a concrete artifact spec.

Deliverable spec (what Tom should ship by Mar 6)

Title: D-EQA-1 — Equity Impact Checklist v1

Format: 2–4 pages or a structured table (Markdown is fine) with:

Screening questions (quick “red/yellow/green” flags)

Deep-dive prompts (when flagged)

Required mitigations / supports (what we do when risk appears)

Metrics & feedback loops (what to watch post-implementation)

“Open questions for committee” (3–7 bullets for Meeting 4 decisions)

Inputs it must reflect (even if placeholders):

Student/staff AI use will happen regardless → plan for disparities, not prevention

Integrity enforcement won’t be detector-driven → avoid inequitable false accusations

Meeting 4 produces top risks + mitigations; WS-EQA should propose equity-related risks/mitigations ready to drop into that register

Dependency note (important): D-EQA-1 depends on Scenario Bank v1 (D-CPX-1) so the checklist can be tested against real classroom scenarios . If CPX is late, Tom should still ship the checklist and add “to validate against scenario set” as an explicit follow-on task.

# 3) Split work cleanly with the co-lead (Elizabeth Chua) (10 min)

Objective: Prevent “lead does everything” failure mode.

Proposed division of labor (fast, low-friction)

Tom (lead):

Own the checklist structure + final assembly

Draft “do-no-harm risk list” and mitigations (discipline equity, access gaps, language learners, SPED/504 impacts)

Elizabeth (co-lead):

Draft accommodations/accessibility section and metrics/monitoring section

Identify “what we need from the district” (high-level device/connectivity/access landscape; accommodations practices)

Joint (30-minute sync):

Decide which items are “required” vs “recommended” vs “context-dependent”

Concrete next step: Schedule one 45-minute working session this week and one 30-minute final-pass session early next week.

# 4) Walk-through: how to use Replit app + JSON + GitHub + Miro efficiently (15 min)

Objective: Tom can self-serve the “source of truth” and use AI productively without creating drift.

A. Replit web app (SoR “dashboard”)

Filter to Meeting 4 and point Tom to his deliverable row: D-EQA-1 due Mar 6 .

Use it to track status; treat it as the “what’s due and when” page.

B. Downloadable JSON (portable context for AI prompting)

Download the deliverables snapshot and use it as a prompt attachment for an LLM:

“Here is our SoR. Generate a checklist structure aligned to D-EQA-1 definition-of-done and Meeting 4 risk register needs.”

Key fields to point to: deliverable ID, due date, dependency on D-CPX-1 .

C. GitHub repo (canonical written product)

Keep the checklist in one file with the deliverable ID in the filename (e.g., D-EQA-1_equity_impact_checklist_v1.md).

Commit early (even as a skeleton), then iterate. This avoids “lost drafts” and makes integration into Policy Skeleton easier.

D. Miro (working surface + evidence)

Use Miro to collect: examples, pain points, equity risks, and “what we say instead” language.

Export a frame as PDF/image when needed; link the exported artifact inside the GitHub doc so evidence stays attached.

# 5) Prepare Tom’s 3–5 minute Meeting 4 briefing (10 min)

Objective: Tom can deliver a tight update that advances decisions.

## Briefing template (scriptable)

One sentence purpose: “WS-EQA produced an Equity Impact Checklist to prevent unintended harm and monitor disparities.”

What’s in v1 (3 bullets):

Screening questions + deep-dive prompts

Mitigation/support actions

Metrics + feedback loop

Top 3 equity risks we want in the Meeting 4 risk register (3 bullets): (examples Tom can tailor)

Access gaps (device/connectivity, home support) → mitigation: structured supports + school-provided options

Disproportionate discipline / integrity disputes → mitigation: process evidence, human review, consistent procedures

Accessibility regressions (ELL/SPED/504) → mitigation: accommodations-aligned guidance and tool criteria

Two decisions needed from committee (ask for action):

Confirm grade-band structure assumptions (so equity tests align)

Confirm policy posture on tool access/governance direction (impacts equity profoundly)

# 6) Close: lock the plan + immediate action items (5 min)

Objective: Leave with commitments, dates, and a first draft target.

Action items (leave lunch with these written down)

Today: Tom creates GitHub file skeleton with headings (30 minutes).

Within 48 hours: Tom + Elizabeth do first working session; produce v0.3 content.

By early next week: “Reviewable v1” ready for Meeting 4 (even if scenario-validation is pending).

One high-leverage “starter prompt” Tom can use with AI (copy/paste)

“Create a K-12 Equity Impact Checklist for an AI policy and AI tools. It must include: screening questions, deep-dive prompts, mitigations/supports, and metrics/feedback loops. Align to these responsibilities: equity impacts (access gaps, accommodations, language, disability), accessibility standards/supports, and monitoring disparities. Deliverable is D-EQA-1 due Meeting 4 (Mar 6). Output as a 2–4 page Markdown checklist with an ‘Open Questions for Committee’ section and a ‘Top Equity Risks + Mitigations for Risk Register’ section.”

(Then attach the JSON export from the Replit app so the model stays grounded.)

Checklist Skeleton (headings + starter table) for D-EQA-1

Paste into GitHub, aligned to the WS-EQA definition-of-done.

|---|---|---|---|

| Access gaps | Provide school-based access windows; device lending; offline alternative |  |  |

| Paid tool advantage | District-provided equivalent; ban paywalls for required work |  |  |

| Accommodations conflict | Explicit accommodation-safe guidance; SPED review step |  |  |

| ELL burden | Approved language supports + examples by grade band |  |  |
