While writing, their brain activity was measured by EEG. The adults were sorted into three groups; those that could write their essay 1) with the help of only chatgpt, 2) with the help of internet resources but no AI assistance, and 3) without any outside help, similar to the environment of taking the SAT. The research found the group that was allowed to use ChatGPT had the lowest brain engagement and “consistently underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels.” In subsequent interviews, this group struggled to recall what they had written, whereas the other groups had retained substantial recall of their work. The essays created by the chatgpt users were more homogeneously written in terms of the concepts used to respond to the prompt and the language used to write the essay. The group that was forced to use only their brains–no outside help–showed the highest neural activity in areas that are associated with creativity, memory, and the ability to process meaning. This paper is not peer-reviewed."
