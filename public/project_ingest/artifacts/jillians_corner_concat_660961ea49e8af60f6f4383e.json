Without structured intervention, the increasing adoption of AI tools risks exacerbating educational disparities rather than reducing them (Holmes et al., 2022)."

These modules are designed to accommodate varying levels of technological familiarity and incorporate trauma-informed approaches (Elliott et al., 2005).\n\n**AI Compliance Frameworks:** Structured protocols and assessment tools that align AI-driven educational decisions with IDEA, FERPA, and Section 504 requirements (Roschelle et al., 2024; Holler & Zirkel, 2008). These frameworks ensure that AI tools support rather than undermine legal protections for students with disabilities. These frameworks translate complex regulations into actionable guidelines, allowing educators to evaluate AI tools against clearly defined compliance standards varying in technological proficiency. They can also be integrated into SAU41's existing professional development structure (SAU41, 2022)."

Despite the growing adoption of AI tools in K-12 education, no standardized federal or state regulations specifically address the ethical risks and compliance concerns associated with AI implementation in SPED (DOE, 2023; Roschelle et al., 2024). This regulatory gap affects approximately 7.5 million students nationwide who rely on special education services, with 31% of schools reporting critical shortages in SPED specialists, school psychologists, and case managers (National Center for Education Statistics, 2024).\n\n>   About 7.5 million U.S. students depend on SPED services, but 31% of schools report a shortage of SPED specialists (NECES, 2024)."

While federal laws such as IDEA, Section 504, and FERPA offer essential protections for students with disabilities, they were not designed to address the unique challenges posed by algorithmic decision-making (Haque & Li, 2024).\n\nThe White House's AI Bill of Rights (2023) emphasizes the importance of bias mitigation and transparency but lacks specific enforcement mechanisms within educational contexts. This regulatory vacuum has created significant vulnerabilities for SPED programs:\n\n**Algorithmic bias in assessment and intervention:** Research by Nguyen et al. (2023) demonstrates that AI systems misclassify students with disabilities from marginalized backgrounds at rates up to 32% higher than their peers, potentially reinforcing existing inequities in identification and service delivery.\n\n9"

Faculty members responsible for preparing future special educators often lack access to comprehensive AI-focused training programs, which inhibits their ability to effectively integrate AI tools and content into teacher preparation (CIDDL,2024). Holmes et al. (2022) highlight significant concerns regarding data privacy and compliance in AI educational systems, noting that 'no framework has been workedout, no guidelines have been agreed, no policies have been developed, and no regulations have been enacted to address the specific ethical issues raised by the use of AI in education' (p. 505)."

The district has experienced persistent SPED staffing shortages since 2022, with critical positions such as school psychologists remaining vacant for multiple school years (SAU41, 2024-b). This staffing crisis has led to delays in SPED service implementation and increased reliance on AI-powered interventions to support overburdened staff. However, SAU41's Professional Growth Master Plan (2022-2027) does not include AI ethics training components, highlighting a critical professional development gap for educators and administrators (SAU41, 2022).\n\n**Continuation of the Problem Statement**\n\n**Intersection with Social Justice Concerns**\n\nThe lack of ethical frameworks for AI in SPED creates particularly significant risks for students with intersecting marginalized identities.

Holmes et al. (2022) express this concern, emphasizing that a major ethical issue is to guarantee that AI systems \"do not show bias against a particular group\" (p. 514) and stressing that these technologies pose a risk of \"diminishing the quality of education for 'certain groups of students'\" (p. 514).\n\nFor students with disabilities who also belong to marginalized racial, cultural, or socioeconomic backgrounds, these risks become even more pronounced. Holmes et al. (2022) recognize this intersectionality challenge, stating that \"classifying students in terms of educational tests must account for the inherent ambiguity and variability in the measure\" (p. 515). Haque and Li (2024) support this concern, noting that AI systems like ChatGPT learn from datasets that \"may contain inherent biases and stereotypes\" and that \"certain social groups are underrepresented in the training data\" (p. 8), potentially leading to unequal outcomes."
