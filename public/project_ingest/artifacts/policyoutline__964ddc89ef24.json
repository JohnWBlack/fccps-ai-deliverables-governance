Generative AI is a form of machine learning that creates new content rather than simply analyzing or classifying existing data. These systems are typically trained on vast datasets composed of publicly available digital content—words, images, and sounds . . . . Contemporary models increasingly incorporate curated, domain specific, and proprietary data tailored to specific applications, including educational ones.”"
