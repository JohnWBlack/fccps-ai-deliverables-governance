We'll share this, and it's meant to be published and shared as well, but we want to share with you very clearly what our plan is over the coming school year. With regard to AI, artificial intelligence is a fast, evolving technology with wide ranging implications for our students, our educators and our school communities. As a school board, we believe it's our responsibility to ensure fccps is preparing students not just for today's world, but for the world they'll inherit. To facilitate that. This school year, we are developing an AI policy for fccps. We do not come to this work with a pre written policy or fixed answers. Instead, we're launching tonight a process to learn with and from our community, students, educators, staff, families and AI experts alike, as we shape the district's first district wide AI policy, our goal is to develop an equitable and pedagogically sound AI policy that reflects both current best practices and research and the insights and perspectives of our"
