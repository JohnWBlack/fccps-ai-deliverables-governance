      "text": "AI tools deployed in SPED settings present numerous ethical concerns,\nincluding algorithmic bias, data privacy vulnerabilities, and the risk\nof over-reliance on AI-generated recommendations (Haque & Li, 2024).\nCurrent AI tools have been reported to disproportionately misclassify\nstudents from marginalized racial and socioeconomic backgrounds, leading\nto inequitable educational interventions (Nguyen et al., 2023).\nAdditionally, AI systems often function as opaque \"black boxes,\" making\nit difficult for educators and parents to understand how decisions\nregarding student learning accommodations are made (Maslej et al.,\n2023). These concerns raise significant legal questions about the\ncompliance of AI-driven SPED interventions with IDEA, Section 504, and\nFERPA, which mandate that students with disabilities receive fair and\nappropriate educational support (Holler & Zirkel, 2008)."

While federal laws such\nas IDEA, Section 504, and FERPA offer essential protections for students\nwith disabilities, they were not designed to address the unique\nchallenges posed by algorithmic decision-making (Haque & Li, 2024).\n\nThe White House's AI Bill of Rights (2023) emphasizes five key\nprinciples for AI use, including algorithmic discrimination protections\nand data privacy, but it is not legally binding and does not provide\nspecific guidance for educational settings (Maslej et al., 2023).\nFurthermore, the U.S. Department of Education has released broad AI\nguidelines, but these are not yet integrated into SPED compliance\nframeworks (DOE, 2023; Roschelle et al., 2024)."

Faculty members\nresponsible for preparing future special educators often lack access to\ncomprehensive AI-focused training programs, which inhibits their ability\nto effectively integrate AI tools and content into teacher preparation\n(CIDDL, 2024). Holmes et al. (2022) highlight significant concerns\nregarding data privacy and compliance in AI educational systems, noting\nthat \"no framework has been worked out, no guidelines have been agreed,\nno policies have been developed, and no regulations have been enacted to\naddress the specific ethical issues raised by the use of AI in\neducation\" (p. 505)."
