      "text": "| RISK 2 Severity: HIGH | IEP/504 Data Exposure Through AI Tools SPED students’ sensitive diagnostic information, behavioral data, and learning accommodations are increasingly processed through AI systems that may lack adequate safeguards (Roschelle et al., 2024). IDEA requires protections beyond standard FERPA, and AI tools were not designed with these requirements in mind (Haque & Li, 2024). |\n| Mitigation | SPED add-on review layer for any tool used with IEP/504 students. Explicit parental/guardian consent for AI processing of disability-related data. Prohibit sharing IEP/504 data with AI vendors without IDEA compliance review. Regular audits of AI tools used in SPED contexts. |\n| Owner | SPED Director + IT Department (joint oversight) + Legal Counsel (IDEA compliance review) |"

AI-driven behavior monitoring may flag cultural behavioral differences as problematic (Maslej et al., 2023). This can reinforce historical overrepresentation of students of color in certain disability categories. |\n| Mitigation | Require algorithmic bias assessment for all Tier 3 tools. Establish routine bias audits with specific focus on outcomes for students with intersecting marginalized identities. Human-in-the-loop requirement for all consequential decisions. Review disaggregated outcome data annually. |\n| Owner | Curriculum & Instruction (bias audits) + SPED Director (disability-specific disability specific review) + Equity Office (intersectionality lens) |"
