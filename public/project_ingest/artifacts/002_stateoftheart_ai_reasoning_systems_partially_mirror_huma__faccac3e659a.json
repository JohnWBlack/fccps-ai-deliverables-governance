Recent work argues for *concept alignment* as a prerequisite to value alignment. 1\n-   **Metacognition and robust critical thinking are nascent.** Research on metalearners, introspection logs, and uncertainty calibration is growing, but these capabilities are not yet as integrated or reliable as human selfmonitoring. 3"
